# Quiz & Music Bingo Starter Pack

90-minute formats that keep teams smiling and the bar busy. Mix and match the elements below, then add your pub’s local colour.

## Quick start checklist

- Pick a night and cap the experience at 90 minutes.
- Print enough answer sheets (plus five spares).
- Test mic, speaker, and any Bluetooth connection.
- Load playlists offline in case the Wi-Fi wobbles.
- Prep prizes: brag board update, £20 tab, partner voucher.
- Drop QR poster near the till for bookings or loyalty stamps.

## Round bank (use three per quiz)

| Round | What to do | Props needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local Legends | 10 questions about history, landmarks, sports teams, or famous locals. | Print two archival photos. |
| Mystery Sound | Play six recorded noises from your venue (pulling a pint, cellar door, milk steamer) and ask teams to identify. | Phone + small speaker. |
| Speed Ladder | 10 quick-fire either/or questions answered on coloured paddles; MC reads them in 90 seconds. | Two-colour paddles or beer mats. |
| Higher/Lower Finale | Teams predict whether the next card/number is higher or lower (use attendance stats, ABVs, or trivia). | Pack of cards or printed stat cards. |

## Music bingo cards

1. Pick a theme (80s anthems, indie disco, Britpop vs. Boybands).
2. Use a bingo card generator (Canva has templates) with 24 tracks plus a free space.
3. Shuffle song order per card.
4. Print on coloured paper so staff can tell rounds apart.

### Playlist suggestions

- **Warm-up (10 mins):** mellow, lyric-light tracks so people can chat.
- **Round 1 (20 mins):** high-energy singalongs at 30–40 seconds per clip.
- **Round 2 (20 mins):** decade mash-up.
- **Round 3 (20 mins):** guilty pleasures or “one-hit wonders”.
- **Encore (10 mins):** current chart bangers to capture social clips.

## Sample MC beats

| Time | Action | Script prompts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 00:00 | Welcome + explain format | “Pens up, phones down, QR at the bar if you want bundle deals.” |
| 00:05 | Round 1 start | “Local Legends to kick off — you’ll only know these if you’ve spent time on our high street.” |
| 00:30 | Break / upsell | “Grab the Quiz Bundle: entry, AF pint, and fries for £10 — shout if you need gluten-free.” |
| 00:40 | Round 2 start | “Mystery Sound round — close your eyes and tell me what’s happening behind the scenes.” |
| 01:10 | Scores & finale | “Top three teams, collect your prizes. Everyone else, scan the QR to pre-book next week.” |

## Print-ready assets (edit in Canva)

## Compliance & safeguarding reminders
