## Design cues for the agency

- Stick to two-column layouts with real pub photography plus simple icons (calendar tiles, arrows, microphone, pint).
- Use the Greene King palette for day icons; keep QR labels short and benefit-led.
- Add a slim Jan–Apr key-dates sidebar with Winter Olympics (6–22 Feb), Six Nations, Valentine’s, Mother’s Day, St Patrick’s, and Easter callouts.
