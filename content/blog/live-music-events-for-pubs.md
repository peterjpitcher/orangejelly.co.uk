# Live Music Events for Pubs: The Complete Guide to Booking, Hosting and Profiting

Live music can transform a quiet night into a destination. It can also annoy regulars and crush margins if it is unmanaged. The difference is a clear progression: start small, prove demand, then scale.

## Step 1: Decide if live music fits your pub

Check three things:
- Do your locals want it?
- Can your room handle sound?
- Can your team handle the extra flow?

If the answer is yes, start simple.

## Step 2: Start with open mic or acoustic sets

Open mic nights are the lowest-risk option. They build a music reputation without large fees. Keep strict time slots and a confident host to prevent chaos.

## Step 3: Move to paid acts

Once demand is proven, book paid acts. Use a clear fee and a trial date. Track spend per head and decide if it is worth repeating.

## Step 4: Control sound and flow

Poor sound ruins music nights. Invest in basic equipment and set volume standards. Ensure staff can still take orders and move through the room.

## Step 5: Build a profit plan

- Add a ticket or deposit for premium tables.
- Create a music night menu.
- Use a drinks bundle to lift spend.

## Common mistakes

- Booking expensive acts without demand proof.
- Ignoring sound quality.
- Forgetting to promote the next gig on the night.

## Quick checklist

- Test night planned.
- Sound setup tested.
- Ticket or deposit option live.
- Menu and bundle ready.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need music licences?**
Yes. Check PRS and PPL requirements before hosting live music.

**How do I stop regulars complaining?**
Keep volume controlled and give them advance notice of music nights.
