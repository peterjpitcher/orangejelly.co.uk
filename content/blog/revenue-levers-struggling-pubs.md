# 9 Revenue Levers Every Struggling Pub Should Pull Today

Monday morning panic only eases when you know exactly which levers produce cash by the weekend. These nine moves are what turned my own wet-led pub from red ink to a surplus in six weeks. None require a refurb, a fancy coffee machine, or merchant loans – just focus and follow-up.

## 1. Relaunch Your Top Two Events
Dig into EPOS history or even scribbled diaries to find the last quiz, themed night, or tasting that actually filled the room. Bring it back with a fresher name, a guaranteed prize, and a £5 advance ticket that includes the first drink. Promote it relentlessly for seven days and treat it like a product launch.

## 2. Bundle Plates and Pints
Create one hero bundle for lunch and one for early evening, both priced for contribution margin not vanity. Think pie, pint, and pudding for £16.95 or two tapas boards plus jug serves. Stick posters on the door, WhatsApp your regulars, and ask staff to mention it to every seated guest.

## 3. Sell Premium Pours on Purpose
Brief the team on three profitable swaps – house gin to local craft, standard lager to imported keg, 175ml wine to a carafe for the table. Role-play the lines at line-up so it feels natural.

## 4. Monetise Dead Space
If a side room sits empty Monday to Thursday, package it for chess clubs, yoga teachers, or remote teams that want an off-site. Charge a minimum spend and throw in filter coffee to make it irresistible.

## 5. Pre-Sell Sunday
Wednesday is the make-or-break day for Sunday trade. Post the roast menu with exact booking slots, take £5 deposits, and text anyone who booked in the past three months. Even ten extra covers stabilise the week.

## 6. Partner on Deliveroo But Stay in Control
Switch the menu to dishes that travel well and carry healthy margins after platform fees. Cap the number of tickets per hour so the kitchen never compromises the pub floor.

## 7. Launch a Locals Card
Print simple stamp cards that reward the fifth visit with sharers or dessert rather than discounts. The perceived progress keeps people coming back even when pockets are tight.

## 8. Reduce Pour Cost Overnight
Audit every keg, spirit, and garnish. Remove the four slowest movers, standardise cocktail specs, and use jiggers religiously. The goal is a two percent margin improvement without a single extra customer.

## 9. Make Every Staff Member a Rainmaker
Hand the team personalised referral codes (use QR cards or social tiles). Any new guest who quotes their code receives a welcome drink, and the staff member pockets £5 credit. Suddenly everyone is marketing for you.

## This Week's Checklist
- Choose the two events, set dates, and build the £5 ticket page today.
- Print and display bundle menus by tomorrow's lunch rush.
- Run a 30-minute upsell drill at every pre-shift briefing.
- Message local groups about room hire and confirm at least one booking.
- Send Sunday booking texts Wednesday noon.

## Mini FAQ
**What if my kitchen is closed midweek?**
Lean harder on event tickets, tasting flights, and room hire until you can reopen food. Cash first, menu later.

**Do I need fancy software for referral codes?**
No. Numbered paper cards or unique emojis in WhatsApp threads work fine. Track redemptions at the till.

Pull even five of these nine levers properly and next week's bank balance will look very different.
