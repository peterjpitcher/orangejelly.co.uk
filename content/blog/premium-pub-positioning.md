# Premium Pub Positioning: How to Go Upmarket and Increase Profits

Let's address the elephant in the room: you're never going to compete with Wetherspoons on price. And that's exactly why you're going to win.

While chains race to the bottom with £2 pints and microwave meals, smart publicans are discovering a powerful truth – there's a growing market of customers who'll happily pay £8 for a pint if you give them a reason to. The secret isn't just charging more; it's delivering an experience that makes premium prices feel like excellent value.

## The Premium Paradox: Why Expensive Can Be More Attractive

Consider this: The Harwood Arms in Fulham charges £16 for a pint of craft beer and has a three-week waiting list. The Wetherspoons 400 metres away charges £3.50 and has empty tables.

Why? Because premium positioning isn't about price – it's about perception, experience, and the stories customers tell themselves and others.

## Understanding the Premium Customer Mindset

Before transforming your pub, understand who you're targeting:

### The Premium Pub Customer:

- **Values experience over expense**: Happy to pay for memorable moments

- **Seeks authenticity**: Wants real stories, real ingredients, real expertise

- **Craves exclusivity**: Not necessarily snobbish, but wants to feel special

- **Shares experiences**: Their social media is their personal brand

- **Quality-conscious**: Understands and appreciates craftsmanship

- **Time-poor, cash-comfortable**: Wants maximum value from limited leisure time

### What They're NOT:

- Necessarily wealthy (many prioritise spending on experiences)

- Snobs (they want warmth with their sophistication)

- Disloyal (premium customers are the most loyal when satisfied)

## The Five Pillars of Premium Positioning

### 1. Product Excellence: The Non-Negotiable Foundation

You cannot fake quality. Every element must deliver:

**Drinks Programme**:

- **Curation over selection**: 6 exceptional gins beat 60 average ones

- **Provenance stories**: Know your producers personally

- **Exclusive products**: Private cask whiskies, brewery collaborations

- **Perfect execution**: Right glass, right temperature, right garnish

- **Education elements**: Tasting notes, pairing suggestions

**Real Example**: The Anchor in Ripley stocks a focused gin list but offers short "gin journey" experiences at a set price, where customers learn about botanicals, distillation, and create their perfect serve.

**Food Excellence**:

- **Hero ingredients**: One perfect steak beats ten average dishes

- **Visible craft**: Open kitchen, bread baked on-site, butchery displays

- **Seasonality**: Menu changes that reflect genuine availability

- **Dietary excellence**: Premium plant-based options, not afterthoughts

- **Plating theatre**: Instagram-worthy without being pretentious

### 2. Service Sophistication: The Emotional Differentiator

Premium service isn't stiff formality – it's intuitive excellence:

**The New Service Standard**:

- **Anticipation**: Remembering preferences without being asked

- **Knowledge**: Staff who can discuss provenance and pairings

- **Personalisation**: Tailoring experiences to individual guests

- **Discretion**: Knowing when to engage and when to disappear

- **Recovery**: Turning problems into memorable solutions

**Training Investment**: Premium groups invest heavily in training and see higher spend per customer.

### 3. Atmosphere Architecture: Designing Premium Feelings

Your space should whisper quality, not shout it:

**Design Principles**:

- **Layered lighting**: Multiple sources, all dimmable

- **Quality materials**: Real wood, proper leather, honest stone

- **Comfort investment**: Chairs people want to stay in

- **Acoustic management**: Conversations possible at every table

- **Sensory signatures**: Subtle scent, carefully curated music

**The Details That Matter**:

- Hand towels in bathrooms (not air dryers)

- Proper coat storage (not hooks on chair backs)

- Phone charging built into tables discreetly

- Fresh flowers (never fake)

- Spotless glassware (invest in proper glass washers)

### 4. Experience Engineering: Beyond Food and Drink

Premium pubs sell memories, not just meals:

**Signature Experiences**:

- **Chef's Table**: Monthly dinners with kitchen interaction

- **Masterclasses**: Cocktail making, wine tasting, butchery

- **Producer Dinners**: Meet the farmer/brewer/distiller

- **Seasonal Rituals**: Oyster openings, game preparation

- **Private Experiences**: Whisky vault access, cellar tours

**Example**: The Hand & Flowers charges £250 for their monthly "Kitchen Table" experience. It sells out in minutes, creating buzz and desire.

### 5. Brand Building: Perception Management

Premium positioning requires consistent brand reinforcement:

**Visual Identity**:

- Professional photography (never phone snapshots)

- Consistent colour palette and typography

- Quality printed materials (feel matters)

- Thoughtful merchandise (not cheap tat)

- Curated social media aesthetic

**Reputation Management**:

- Respond to every review thoughtfully

- Seek quality press coverage

- Build relationships with food critics

- Create shareable moments

- Partner with premium brands

## Pricing Psychology: The Art of Premium

### The Price-Quality Signal

Higher prices can actually increase satisfaction through expectation:

**Pricing Strategies**:

- **Anchor pricing**: One very expensive option makes others seem reasonable

- **Odd pricing**: £8.75 feels more considered than £9

- **Bundle elevation**: Premium packages that add value

- **Time-based premiums**: Peak pricing for peak experience

- **Member pricing**: Exclusivity through access, not discounts

### Justifying Premium Prices

Never apologise for prices. Instead, reinforce value:

**Value Reinforcement**:

- Origin stories on menus

- Production method highlights

- Exclusivity messaging

- Quality guarantees

- Experience inclusions

**Example Menu Copy**:

"28-day aged Belted Galloway ribeye from Jamie's farm in Northumberland, served with triple-cooked chips and bone marrow butter - £32"

vs

"Ribeye steak and chips - £32"

## Premium Marketing: Attracting the Right Customers

### Digital Sophistication

Your online presence must match your premium positioning:

**Website Excellence**:

## FAQs

### Won't I lose all my regular customers?

Not if managed properly. Keep some accessible options, communicate changes clearly, and show existing customers extra appreciation during transition.

### How much investment is required?

Initial investment can be significant, but a phased approach works. Often, improved margins fund ongoing improvements.

### What if there's no premium market locally?

Create it. The Sportsman is in Seasalter (population: 500). Excellence creates its own market.

### How quickly can I increase prices?

Raise prices modestly with visible improvements, then adjust as quality demonstrates value.

### Should I change my pub's name?

Usually no. Heritage has value. Evolution beats revolution for community acceptance.

### What's the biggest mistake in going premium?

Pretension. Premium means excellent quality delivered warmly, not snobbery.

## The Premium Promise

Going premium isn't about excluding people – it's about including them in something special. It's not about being expensive – it's about being excellent. It's not about pretension – it's about passion.

In a world where everything's becoming commoditised, standardised, and digitised, the hunger for real, crafted, human experiences is growing exponentially. Premium positioning puts you directly in front of this trend.

Yes, Wetherspoons will always be cheaper. Let them. While they're converting price-shoppers, you'll be creating advocates. While they're processing transactions, you'll be crafting memories. While they're cutting costs, you'll be adding value.

The future belongs to pubs that stand for something more than just a place to drink. Premium positioning isn't just a business strategy – it's a declaration that excellence matters, that craft deserves recognition, and that some experiences are worth paying for.

Your pub deserves to be one of them. Your community deserves to have one of them. And you deserve to run one of them.

The only question is: are you ready to stop competing on price and start competing on priceless?
