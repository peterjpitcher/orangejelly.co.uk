# Why Is My Pub Empty? 12 Brutal Truths and How to Fix Them

Staring at empty chairs on what should be a busy Friday night? You're not alone, and more importantly, it's fixable. But first, we need to have an honest conversation about why punters are walking past your doors.

## The Hard Truth: It's Not Just the Economy

When I bought The Anchor in 2019, I blamed everything except myself for our empty pub. The weather, the economy, changing drinking habits, Netflix, the lot. It took a brutal conversation with a regular (after one too many) for me to realise: **the problem was staring back at me in the mirror**.

### The Real Cost of an Empty Pub

Before we dive into solutions, let's quantify what those empty seats are costing you:

- **Fixed costs continue**: Rent, rates, and utilities don't care if you serve 5 or 50 customers

- **Staff morale plummets**: Nothing kills team spirit like tumbleweeds at 8pm on a Saturday

- **Reputation spirals**: Empty pubs look uninviting, creating a vicious cycle

- **Mental health toll**: The stress of a failing pub is crushing

At our lowest point, we were losing £2,000 per week. That's not sustainable for anyone.

## The 12 Reasons Your Pub Is Empty (And How to Fix Each One)

### 1. You've Become Invisible to Your Community

**The Problem**: When did you last give locals a reason to think about your pub?

**The Fix**:

- Create a weekly email newsletter (even 50 subscribers make a difference)

- Post on social media daily, not just when you remember

- Partner with local groups, sports clubs, and businesses

- Become the community noticeboard

**What Worked for Us**: We started featuring a "Local Hero of the Week" with their photo on our Facebook page. Engagement surged.

### 2. Your Pub Lacks a Clear Identity

**The Problem**: Trying to be everything to everyone means you're nothing to anyone.

**The Fix**:

- Define your core customer (age, interests, spending power)

- Build everything around serving them brilliantly

- Be known for something specific

- Communicate your identity consistently

**Real Example**: We positioned ourselves as "The Anchor: Your Local Living Room" - cosy, welcoming, no pretensions.

### 3. Your Beer Selection Is Stuck in 1995

**The Problem**: Three bitters and a lager doesn't cut it anymore.

**The Fix**:

- Stock at least one local craft beer

- Rotate guest ales monthly

- Offer proper non-alcoholic options (not just Becks Blue)

- Train staff to recommend and upsell

**Result**: Our wet sales lifted after expanding our craft range.

### 4. Your Food Offering Is an Afterthought

**The Problem**: Microwaved lasagne isn't bringing anyone through the door.

**The Fix**:

- Focus on 5-6 dishes done brilliantly

- Use local suppliers and shout about it

- Offer legitimate vegetarian/vegan options

- Price for value, not cheapness

**Our Success**: Switching to a simple, quality menu increased food sales significantly.

### 5. Your Opening Hours Don't Match Customer Needs

**The Problem**: Opening at 5pm when everyone finishes work at 5:30pm.

**The Fix**:

- Survey when people actually want to visit

- Consider breakfast/coffee offerings

- Adjust hours seasonally

- Be consistent (unpredictable hours kill trade)

**Key Learning**: Opening at 4pm instead of 5pm captured the after-school parent crowd.

### 6. Your Staff Look Miserable

**The Problem**: Nothing empties a pub faster than surly service.

**The Fix**:

- Hire for personality, train for skills

- Empower staff to solve problems

- Share the week's targets and celebrate wins

- Lead by example with your own attitude

**The Difference**: Happy staff increased our TripAdvisor rating from 3.2 to 4.6 stars.

### 7. Your Pub Looks Tired and Unloved

**The Problem**: Sticky carpets and faded décor scream "we've given up."

**The Fix** (on a budget):

- Deep clean everything (costs nothing but time)

- Fresh paint in key areas

- Update lighting (biggest impact for least cost)

- Fix the small things (wobbly tables, broken toilet locks)

**Smart Spend**: £500 on new lighting transformed our atmosphere more than £5,000 on furniture would have.

### 8. You're Not Creating Reasons to Visit

**The Problem**: Same old pub, same old pint, no compelling events.

**The Fix**:

- Theme nights that match your identity

- Partner with local food vendors

- Host community events

- Create "can't miss" weekly fixtures

**Winner**: "Pie and Pint Wednesdays" now account for a meaningful share of our weekly revenue.

### 9. Your Prices Are Wrong (Too High OR Too Low)

**The Problem**: Pricing sends powerful signals about who you're for.

**The Fix**:

- Research competitor pricing thoroughly

- Price for your target customer

- Create clear value tiers

- Don't compete on price alone

**Insight**: A modest price increase paired with quality improvements lost a couple of customers but lifted profit.

### 10. You've Ignored the Digital Age

**The Problem**: Invisible online means invisible in real life.

**The Fix**:

- Claim and update your Google My Business listing

- Respond to every review (good and bad)

- Maintain active social media presence

- Ensure your website is mobile-friendly

**Shocking Stat**: Most of our new customers check us online before visiting.

### 11. Your Atmosphere Is Wrong

**The Problem**: Too loud, too quiet, too bright, too dark - atmosphere matters.

**The Fix**:

- Music should match your crowd

- Lighting creates mood (dimmers are your friend)

- Temperature control is crucial

- Create distinct zones for different needs

**Simple Win**: Adding background music at the right volume increased dwell time noticeably.

### 12. You've Stopped Listening to Customers

**The Problem**: Assuming you know what customers want without asking.

**The Fix**:

- Regular customer surveys

- Act on feedback visibly

- Create a suggestion box (and use it)

- Talk to people, not at them

**Game Changer**: Monthly "Landlord's Forum" where customers tell me what's working and what isn't.

## The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything

Stop thinking like a failing publican and start thinking like a hospitality entrepreneur. Every empty chair is feedback. Every quiet night is data. Every lost customer is a lesson.

## Common Excuses That Keep Pubs Empty

### "It's just a quiet period"

Every period is quiet if you don't give people reasons to come out.

### "Locals don't spend money anymore"

Maybe they're spending it somewhere that gives them value.

### "Young people don't use pubs"

They do, just not pubs stuck in the past.

### "I can't compete with Wetherspoons"

Don't try. Compete on experience, not price.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can I turn around an empty pub?

Meaningful change takes 3-6 months. Significant transformation takes 12-18 months. Small improvements can happen immediately.

### What if I can't afford big changes?

Start with free changes: attitude, cleanliness, consistency. Build from there.

### Should I rebrand completely?

Evolution beats revolution. Make incremental improvements unless you're truly toxic to the community.

### What's the single most important thing to fix first?

Your mindset. Everything else follows from believing your pub can succeed.

### How do I know which changes are working?

Track everything: footfall, spend per head, return visits, social media engagement. Data doesn't lie.

## The Challenge: Your First Step Today

Right now, walk through your pub as if you've never been there before. What's the first thing that would make you leave? Fix that today. Not tomorrow. Today.

## Ready to Fill Those Empty Seats?

Empty pubs don't fix themselves. But with honest assessment, strategic changes, and relentless execution, you can transform your struggling pub into the heart of your community.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the main reason pubs are empty?

The primary cause is usually poor visibility and communication. Customers don't know what's happening at your pub. Secondary factors include atmosphere, value perception, and competition. Fixing visibility through social media and events typically lifts footfall.

### Which day of the week is usually quietest?

Tuesday is typically the quietest day for most pubs, followed by Monday and Wednesday. Combat this with specific midweek offers, regular events like quiz nights, and targeted social media campaigns. The Anchor saw weekday revenue lift ~20% using these strategies.

### How quickly will I see results?

Most strategies show meaningful, bankable progress inside 30 days. Week 1 brings more website traffic and phone calls, week 2 builds momentum and tuning, week 4 delivers noticeably fuller evenings and consistent enquiries. Full transformation typically takes six months of consistent implementation.

### How much will this cost to implement?

Implementation costs vary by strategy. Many improvements like social media optimisation and operational changes cost nothing beyond time. Events may require £50-200 initial investment. Professional support is available at £75 per hour plus VAT.

### Can this work for my type of pub?

Yes, these strategies are proven across wet-led, food-led, and hybrid pubs. The key is adapting the approach to your specific circumstances, customer base, and local market. All strategies come from real-world success at The Anchor.
