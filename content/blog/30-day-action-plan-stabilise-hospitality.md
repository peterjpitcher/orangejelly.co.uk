# Checklist: 30-Day Action Plan to Stabilise a Struggling Hospitality Business

If your week feels like survival mode, this plan gives you a clear order of play. It is not a magic fix, it is a stabilisation rhythm that stops the bleed, restores confidence, and creates early proof for landlords, suppliers, and your team. Each week has a purpose, and every day has a practical task you can complete inside a normal shift.

The goal is simple: cash clarity, a tighter offer, a sales lift, then repeatable systems. You are building a runway, not a one-off spike.

## Week 1: Cash and clarity (stop the bleed)

This week is about visibility. If you cannot see cash in and cash out by day, you are guessing.

**Day 1: Build the cash map**
Create a 13-week cashflow sheet and highlight red days. Include rent, wages, VAT, supplier payments, and any loan repayments. This is the baseline for every decision this month.

**Day 2: Triage suppliers**
Call your top five suppliers and agree a payment plan. Lead with a simple plan, not a plea. A structured repayment schedule beats silence every time.

**Day 3: Audit stock and sell down**
Identify slow movers and design a clear sell-down. This is not discount chaos. It is a short, focused clearance that frees cash and space.

**Day 4: Cut the leaks**
Pause non-essential spend, cancel unused subscriptions, and renegotiate services. Aim for small wins across many lines.

**Day 5: Share the reality**
Brief the team with honesty and a clear target. Set a daily sales focus and make it visible in the staff room.

**Day 6: Launch a cash forward offer**
Gift cards with a small bonus or event deposits are the fastest way to bring future cash forward without hurting margins.

**Day 7: Review and reset**
Update the cash forecast and adjust the plan for Week 2. Do not skip this. The weekly review is where momentum is built.

## Week 2: Offer reset (simplify and sharpen)

Week 2 fixes the product. Too many pubs fail because the offer is unclear or too wide.

**Day 8: Run a guest pulse check**
Ask five regulars and five new guests what they actually come for. One clear insight is enough to reshape the week.

**Day 9: Pick the hero offer**
Choose one main food offer and one drinks focus. Fewer items, stronger margin, easier training.

**Day 10: Cost and price properly**
Build a price ladder (entry, mid, premium). You are not just setting prices, you are setting choices.

**Day 11: Update every listing**
Menus, website, Google, and socials must match. Consistency drives confidence.

**Day 12: Reset atmosphere**
A deep clean, lighting tweak, and playlist refresh can change perception overnight. Make the room feel alive.

**Day 13: Train for the new offer**
Run a staff tasting and a 10-minute upsell drill. If they cannot describe it, it will not sell.

**Day 14: Soft launch to regulars**
Invite regulars first, capture feedback, and use their words in your marketing copy.

## Week 3: Sales sprint (create urgency)

Week 3 is about visibility and bookings. You are creating a short burst of demand that proves the plan works.

**Day 15: Announce one clear event**
Launch one event or offer with a date and a cap. Scarcity sells.

**Day 16: Capture content**
Take photos and short videos of the new offer. Do it once, then reuse all week.

**Day 17: Direct outreach**
Door-drop 200 local flyers or send personal messages to lapsed regulars. Direct contact beats broad posts.

**Day 18: Partner locally**
Pair with a local brand or group to widen reach and make the event feel bigger.

**Day 19: Run a locals night**
Make it easy to say yes: a clear bundle and a simple booking flow.

**Day 20: Capture social proof**
Ask for photos, reviews, and short testimonials. You need proof for Week 4.

**Day 21: Review and repeat**
Which channel converted? Do not guess. Use bookings and receipts to decide.

## Week 4: Systemise (make it repeatable)

Week 4 is where you lock in the habits that keep you stable.

**Day 22: Document the basics**
Write simple opening, closing, and service checklists. This lowers stress and protects standards.

**Day 23: Build a daily dashboard**
One page: covers, average spend, GP, labour percentage. Keep it visible.

**Day 24: Launch a loyalty or referral loop**
Reward the fifth visit, not the first. Repeat trade is your easiest growth lever.

**Day 25: Negotiate with data**
Use your progress to reopen landlord or supplier conversations. Data changes the tone.

**Day 26: Cross-train**
Make sure two people can cover each key station. This reduces single points of failure.

**Day 27: Build the next 8-week calendar**
Book the next two events and lock in the main weekly rhythm.

**Day 28: Share the story**
Post a short update about the turnaround. People support progress.

**Day 29: Fix the friction**
Ask the team what still feels broken. Remove the obstacles.

**Day 30: Celebrate and reset**
Thank the team, publish the wins, and start the next 30-day cycle.

## Common mistakes that kill momentum

- Changing too many things at once.
- Discounting without a margin plan.
- Waiting for perfect branding before selling the new offer.
- Skipping the weekly cash review.

## Quick checklist

- Cash forecast updated weekly.
- One hero offer and one hero event live.
- Team trained on scripts and upsells.
- One local outreach channel activated.
- Daily dashboard visible to the team.

## Mini FAQ

**Is 30 days enough to fix a struggling pub?**
It is enough to stabilise and prove the business has a future. Keep cycling the plan until growth feels normal.

**What if I miss a day?**
Do not quit the plan. Shift the task and keep the weekly structure intact.
