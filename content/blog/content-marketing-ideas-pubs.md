# Content Marketing for Pubs: Stories That Fill Seats and Build Loyalty

Content marketing works for pubs because it turns your real story into demand. You do not need viral videos. You need consistent, human content that makes your pub feel like a place people want to be.

This guide breaks content into four pillars that are easy to run every week.

## Pillar 1: Story and identity

Tell people who you are and why you exist. This builds emotional connection.

Examples:
- Your origin story and why you took on the pub.
- A regular's story and what the pub means to them.
- A staff spotlight and their favourite drink.

Keep stories short and specific. People remember the details.

## Pillar 2: Proof and social life

Guests want to see other guests. Show real people enjoying the place.

- Event photos and short clips.
- Reviews and quotes from locals.
- Behind-the-scenes setup shots.

Proof content converts more than polished ads.

## Pillar 3: Useful information

Useful content removes friction and answers questions.

- Menu highlights and booking details.
- What's on this week.
- Parking, accessibility, or dog-friendly info.

The easiest win is making it easy to plan a visit.

## Pillar 4: Offers and events

Use content to drive action. A good post has a clear offer and a clear booking path.

- "12 tables left for Thursday."
- "Deposit link for Christmas parties."
- "New tasting board available now."

## Simple weekly rhythm

- Monday: what is on this week.
- Wednesday: a story or staff feature.
- Friday: social proof or event recap.
- Sunday: next week teaser.

## Common mistakes

- Posting without a clear CTA.
- Only posting menus and opening hours.
- Waiting for perfect photos.

## Quick checklist

- Four pillars covered across the week.
- One clear CTA per post.
- At least one proof post weekly.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need professional photos?**
No. Consistent, clear phone photos beat no posts.

**How many posts per week?**
Three to four is enough if they are consistent.
