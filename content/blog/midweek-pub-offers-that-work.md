# Midweek Pub Offers That Actually Drive Profits (Not Just Footfall)

"Two-for-one on everything!" might pack your pub on a Wednesday, but if you're losing money on every customer, you're just busy being broke. After testing dozens of midweek promotions at The Anchor, here's what actually drives profitable trade, not just bodies through the door.

## The Midweek Mathematics: Understanding Your True Costs

### The Hidden Cost of Desperate Discounting

Let me share a painful lesson. In desperation, we once ran "50% off all food Wednesday." Results:

- **Customers**: Way up (amazing!)

- **Revenue**: Up modestly (decent)

- **Profit**: Down sharply (disaster)

- **Kitchen**: Overwhelmed and chaotic

- **Weekend trade**: Dropped (customers waited for discounts)

The real kicker? Regular customers told us the pub felt "cheap" and started dining elsewhere on weekends.

### The Profitable Midweek Formula

Before diving into what works, understand this equation:

**Profitable Promotion = (Increased Volume × Maintained Margins) + Added Value - Hidden Costs**

Every successful midweek offer balances these elements.

## 14 Midweek Offers That Actually Make Money

### 1. "Wine & Dine Wednesdays"

**The Offer**: Specific wine bottles at £15 when dining (usually £22-25).

**Why It Works**:

- Wine has huge margins even discounted

- Appeals to higher-spending demographic

- Creates midweek date night tradition

**Our Results**:

- Average spend: Strong per couple

- Profit margin: Healthy

- Return rate: Strong within the month

### 2. "The Midweek Feasts"

**The Strategy**: Premium set menus, not discounts.

**Tuesday**: Steak Night - 8oz sirloin, chips, sauce £15

**Wednesday**: Burger & Craft Beer £14

**Thursday**: Curry Club - curry, rice, naan, beer £13

**Key Insight**: Fixed offerings reduce kitchen complexity while maintaining margins.
