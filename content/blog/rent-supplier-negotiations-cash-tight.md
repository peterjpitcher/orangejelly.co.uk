# Handling Rent and Supplier Negotiations When Cash Is Tight

Ignoring calls never works. Suppliers escalate to solicitors, landlords change locks, and the stress multiplies. Instead, use structure and empathy to win time.

## Step 1: Know Your Numbers
Prepare a one-page pack including:
- 13-week cashflow forecast.
- Sales pipeline (events, bookings, partnerships).
- Cost-cutting measures already actioned.
- Amount owed and proposed timeline to clear it.

## Step 2: Book the Conversation
Request a formal meeting or video call. Agenda: current position, turnaround plan, proposed repayment schedule, next check-in date. Formality shows respect.

## Step 3: Lead With Transparency
Explain why the arrears occurred (trade drop, equipment failure). Own mistakes, avoid blaming the other party, and emphasise what you have already fixed.

## Step 4: Propose, Do Not Beg
Example script: "I owe £6,000. I can pay £1,500 today, then £1,500 every fortnight funded by the attached campaign. If I miss a payment, you have permission to switch me back to pro-forma." Give them control without surrendering hope.

## Step 5: Put It in Writing
Send minutes within 24 hours summarising commitments from both sides. Use DocuSign or even an email trail, but capture signatures if the landlord adjusts lease terms.

## Step 6: Communicate Weekly
Even if there is no change, send a Friday update covering sales, payments made, and next milestones. Consistency rebuilds trust faster than sporadic windfalls.

## Mini FAQ
**What if they say no?**
Ask what evidence would change their mind. Offer collateral (equipment, personal guarantee) only if you can honour it. If talks stall entirely, seek mediation via trade bodies or legal advice.

**Should I involve other tenants or suppliers?**
Do not gossip, but compare terms discreetly to ensure you are not accepting unfair treatment. Collective bargaining sometimes yields better energy or beer contracts.

Professional, proactive negotiation keeps doors open long enough for the turnaround to land.
