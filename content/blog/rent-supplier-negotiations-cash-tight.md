# Handling Rent and Supplier Negotiations When Cash Is Tight

Ignoring the phone does not fix cash pressure. The best outcome comes from early, honest negotiation backed by data and a clear plan.

This is the structure that keeps relationships intact while you buy time.

## Step 1: Know your numbers

Prepare a short data pack:
- Last 8 weeks of takings.
- Forecast for the next 8 weeks.
- A clear repayment plan.

This turns a difficult conversation into a professional one.

## Step 2: Book the conversation

Ask for a short call rather than sending a long email. It is easier to build trust when you speak directly.

## Step 3: Lead with transparency

Explain what happened and what you are doing about it. Avoid excuses. Focus on actions already taken.

## Step 4: Propose, do not beg

Suggest a temporary adjustment:
- Split payments over two months.
- A short payment holiday with a clear restart date.
- A smaller weekly payment plus a catch-up plan.

People respond better to clear proposals than open-ended requests.

## Step 5: Put it in writing

Summarise the agreement in an email the same day. It protects both sides and avoids confusion later.

## Step 6: Communicate weekly

A short weekly update keeps trust high and prevents surprises.

## Common mistakes

- Waiting until the payment is overdue.
- Asking for help without a plan.
- Overpromising and missing the new schedule.

## Quick checklist

- Data pack prepared.
- Call booked.
- Clear proposal ready.
- Agreement confirmed in writing.
- Weekly update scheduled.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I negotiate with suppliers or landlord first?**
Start with the most urgent payment and the partner most likely to work with you.

**How long should a payment plan last?**
Keep it short and realistic. Six to twelve weeks is usually workable.
