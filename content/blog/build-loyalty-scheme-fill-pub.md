# How to Build a Loyalty Scheme That Fills the Pub Every Friday

Punch cards are nostalgic but they rarely change behavior. Real loyalty is about giving people a reason to choose you more often, and a clear reward for doing it. A good scheme creates progress, identity, and a small win every time someone returns.

This guide shows you how to build a simple, trackable loyalty scheme that drives frequency without heavy discounts.

## Step 1: Define the behavior you want

Start with one clear goal. Do you want midweek visits, higher spend per head, or more group bookings? Pick the single behavior that moves cash fastest and build the scheme around it.

Example goals:
- Two visits per week from locals.
- Bookings for quieter nights.
- Add-on purchases like desserts or premium pours.

## Step 2: Keep the mechanics simple

If guests cannot understand it in 10 seconds, it fails. Use one of these simple mechanics:
- **Stamp card**: 5th visit earns a reward.
- **Spend ladder**: every 50 pounds unlocks a small perk.
- **Event streak**: attend three events, unlock a priority booking slot.

Choose one mechanic and stick to it for at least eight weeks.

## Step 3: Build a reward ladder

Rewards should feel personal and progress based. Avoid deep discounts and focus on perks that make people feel special.

Example ladder:
- Visit 2: free soft drink or coffee.
- Visit 3: early access to next event booking.
- Visit 5: free sharer or dessert.
- Visit 8: name on a VIP board and a small merch gift.

This ladder costs less than you think, but it feels meaningful to guests.

## Step 4: Choose lightweight tracking

You do not need a complex app. Use what your team can run.

Options:
- Paper stamp cards kept behind the bar.
- Simple digital stamps using a QR form and a shared spreadsheet.
- A booking system tag that tracks repeat visits.

Whatever you choose, train the team to mention it every time.

## Step 5: Launch loudly and locally

A loyalty scheme only works if people know it exists. Announce it for two weeks in every channel.

- Pin it on Instagram and Facebook.
- Put a small sign on every table.
- Ask staff to mention it at the first round.

Keep the message simple: join, collect, unlock.

## Step 6: Measure and refine weekly

Track three numbers each week:
- New sign-ups.
- Returning visits.
- Redemptions.

If redemptions are too high, adjust the reward. If sign-ups are low, adjust the script or signage.

## Example: A Friday focus scheme

Goal: drive Friday bookings without discounting the menu.

- Reward: book Friday twice in a month and unlock a reserved table plus a sharer board.
- Tracking: booking form tag and a simple spreadsheet.
- Result: Fridays feel special, and regulars plan ahead.

## Common mistakes

- Offering discounts that cut margin.
- Using a complicated points system.
- Forgetting to train the team on the script.
- Changing the scheme too quickly.

## Quick checklist

- One clear goal chosen.
- One simple mechanic selected.
- Reward ladder written and costed.
- Staff script trained and repeated.
- Weekly metrics tracked.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I use an app?**
Only if the team will actually use it. Paper can outperform tech if it is consistent.

**What if customers forget their card?**
Keep the cards behind the bar or let staff log visits with a phone number.
