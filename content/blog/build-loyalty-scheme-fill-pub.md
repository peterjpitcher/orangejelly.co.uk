# How to Build a Loyalty Scheme That Fills the Pub Every Friday

Punch cards are nostalgic but rarely move the needle. Modern loyalty is about VIP access, shortcuts to treats, and data you can act on. Follow these steps to create a programme guests brag about.

## Step 1: Define the Behaviour You Want
Aim for repeat visits and referrals, not one-off splurges. Reward every third visit with a perk and give extra credit when members bring new friends.

## Step 2: Choose Lightweight Tech
Options:
- **Paper + POS**: numbered stamp cards tied to guest profiles in your EPOS.
- **WhatsApp Broadcast**: collect opt-ins, log visits manually, and send surprise upgrades.
- **Email CRM**: use Mailchimp tags or Airship to track tiers.

Pick the tool your team will actually update.

## Step 3: Design the Reward Ladder
Example:
- Visit 3: upgrade to premium pint or dessert on us.
- Visit 6: priority booking for Friday tables plus sharing board.
- Visit 9: invite to member-only tasting.
- Refer a friend: both get welcome cocktail.

Keep rewards experiential rather than discount-heavy.

## Step 4: Launch Loudly
Host a "Founders Friday" where the first 100 members get enamel badges and a Polaroid on the loyalty wall. Capture emails/phone numbers, explain how points work, and start logging immediately.

## Step 5: Communicate Weekly
Every Monday, send members availability updates, secret menu items, or playlist previews. On Thursday afternoon, remind them how close they are to the next perk. Scarcity converts.

## Step 6: Measure and Optimise
Track number of members, visits per member, and incremental spend. Survey top members quarterly to learn what they value most.

## Mini FAQ
**What if staff forget to log visits?**
Integrate the loyalty check into bill presentation: "Are you on our Locals List?" Add a till prompt so no bill closes without the question being asked.

**Can I charge for membership?**
Yes, once the scheme proves itself. Offer a paid "Founders Plus" tier with guaranteed seating, concierge bookings, and exclusive tastings.

Done right, loyalty becomes your cheapest marketing channel and ensures Fridays feel like a celebration, not a gamble.
