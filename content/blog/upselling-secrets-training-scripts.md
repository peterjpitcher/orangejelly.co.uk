# Upselling Secrets: Training Scripts That Don't Sound Pushy

Upselling is service, not sleaze. Guests appreciate guidance when it is rooted in their preferences. Use these scripts and drills to increase spend per head by 10% while keeping reviews glowing.

## Step 1: Start With Questions
Teach staff to ask one discovery question per interaction:
- "Are you in the mood for something refreshing or cosy tonight?"
- "Celebrating anything or just a chilled catch-up?"
Their answer dictates the upsell lane.

## Step 2: Offer Two Curated Options
People freeze when given six choices. Script two contrasting upgrades:
- "If you fancy local, our Wye Valley pale is flying. If you want silky, the milk stout just landed."
- "Chef can add smoked bone marrow to that steak or we can swap to the dry-aged cut for £4 extra."

## Step 3: Use Bridge Phrases
Provide connective tissue so the upsell feels like a favour:
- "Most regulars pair that with..."
- "Because it is chilly, guests are loving..."
- "To make it a bit special, we can..."

## Step 4: Drill Daily
Run 5-minute role plays at lineup. One person plays a guest archetype (first date, rugby team, solo diner) and the other must ask, recommend, and close with confidence. Rotate pairs so everyone practices.

## Step 5: Track and Celebrate
Add an upsell KPI to the whiteboard: desserts attached, premium pours sold, large wine upgrades. Celebrate streaks with instant rewards and share exact phrasing that worked.

## Mini FAQ
**What if guests say no?**
Thank them and move on. A polite refusal still shows you care. The goal is relevance, not pressure.

**Should I script entire conversations?**
Provide frameworks, not word-for-word lines. Authenticity matters; the team should adapt scripts to their voice once they grasp the structure.

Great upselling feels like matchmaking. Nail the approach and guests will thank you for spending more.
