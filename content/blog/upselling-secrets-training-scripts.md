# Upselling Secrets: Training Scripts That Do Not Sound Pushy

Upselling is not about pressure. It is about guiding guests to something better. The right scripts feel helpful, not salesy, and they lift spend per head immediately.

Use this structure to train your team in short, repeatable sessions.

## Step 1: Start with questions

Ask one simple preference question before recommending.

Examples:
- "Do you like crisp or hoppy beers?"
- "Are you in the mood for something sweet or dry?"

## Step 2: Offer two curated options

Give a clear choice. It feels supportive and speeds decisions.

Example:
"You could go for the house gin, or our local small-batch gin. The local one is a little smoother."

## Step 3: Use bridge phrases

Bridge phrases connect the upsell to the guest's goal.

- "If you want something lighter..."
- "If you are eating, this pairs well with..."
- "If you want to treat yourself..."

## Step 4: Drill daily

Run a two-minute role play before service. Focus on one category at a time: beer, wine, spirits, or food add-ons.

## Step 5: Track and celebrate

Pick one upsell focus each week and celebrate wins publicly. Recognition makes the habit stick.

## Scripts by category

**Beer**: "We have the house lager, or the local IPA that is fresher and a bit more aromatic."

**Wine**: "Would you like a glass or a carafe for the table? The carafe works out better per glass."

**Spirits**: "Would you like the standard pour or the premium that is aged longer?"

**Food add-on**: "Most people add the rosemary fries or the slaw with that."

## Common mistakes

- Asking "anything else?" without a suggestion.
- Training once and never repeating.
- Incentivising volume instead of margin.

## Quick checklist

- One question script per category.
- Two-minute pre-shift drill scheduled.
- Weekly upsell target chosen.

## Mini FAQ

**Will guests feel pressured?**
Not if you ask a preference question first and present the upsell as a helpful option.

**How long before it works?**
Most teams see a lift within a week when the scripts are used consistently.
