# Cash Bingo 101: Responsible Formats, Smooth Operations, Happy Players

Cash bingo is pure nostalgia: dabbers in hand, friends cheering, and prizes that feel achievable. It’s also regulated, so this guide balances fun with the key compliance steps UK pubs must follow. Treat it as planning guidance—not legal advice—and always check the latest Gambling Commission and local authority rules before you advertise or accept money.

## Quick Compliance Snapshot

- Bingo in alcohol-licensed premises can usually run as **exempt equal-chance gaming** without a Gambling Commission operating licence—as long as you stay within stake/prize limits and follow the conditions. ([Gambling Commission](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/exempt-gaming-in-pubs))
- Maximum stakes: no more than £5 per person per game.
- Combined stakes/prizes from bingo must not exceed £2,000 within any seven-day period; if you go over you must obtain the relevant bingo operating licence.
- No participation fees—charge for books/tickets only.
- Keep clear records of takings and payouts, and display house rules plus responsible gambling information.

## Know Your Format: 90-ball Bingo

UK pubs typically run 90-ball bingo:

- Tickets are 3 rows × 9 columns, 15 numbers per ticket.
- Wins: one line, two lines, full house.
- Each strip/book contains six tickets covering numbers 1–90.

If you do something different (75-ball US-style cards, themed variations), explain it clearly at the start and note whether it fits exempt gaming rules.

## Kit and Setup

| Item | Purpose | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bingo machine/cage or digital randomiser | Draws numbers | Test before doors; keep a spare set of balls. |
| Caller’s book + number board | Tracking draws | Visible board helps reduce disputes. |
| Tickets/books + dabbers | Player materials | Colour-code per game for clarity. |
| PA/mic | Ensure numbers are heard | Keep volume just above background chatter. |
| Float + cash box | Manage book sales | Two staff sign off at start and finish. |
| Winners log | Compliance trail | Record name/team, prize, time. |

## Money Handling and Payout Models

- **Pricing:** e.g., £1 per single strip, £3 per book of three games, £10 “night pass” including snack or drink.
- **Payout:** publish a simple table such as £10 for one line, £20 for two lines, £40 for full house in each of the first four games, then end with a £50 full-house jackpot.
- **Float reconciliation:** use a cash sheet noting start float, books sold, total sales, payouts, end float, variance explanation.

> **Cash reconciliation template**  
> Start float £____  
> Books sold ___ @ £___ = £____  
> Single tickets ___ @ £___ = £____  
> Total sales £____  
> Prizes paid £____  
> End float £____  
> Over/under £____ (explain variance)  
> Signed: Seller ___ / Manager ___

## Hosting and Pace

- **Caller style:** clear diction, consistent tempo (~1 number every 3–4 seconds). Use traditional call phrases (“Two little ducks – 22”) sparingly unless the crowd expects them.
- **Verification:** when someone shouts, pause the draw, have the runner check the card against the caller’s master ticket, then announce “All verified!” before resuming.
- **Tie-breaks:** either split the prize or run a rapid-fire bonus question. Publish the policy beforehand.

## Responsible Play and Safeguarding

- Challenge 25 signage and trained staff for age checks (bingo participation is 18+).
- “Keep it fun” messaging on posters and tables; display links to support services (GamCare, BeGambleAware).
- Allow players to self-exclude from future nights if needed; log any requests confidentially.
- Watch alcohol intake—refuse sales to intoxicated guests who want to carry on playing.

## Run-of-Show (120 Minutes)

| Time | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 19:00–19:15 | Doors open, sell books, explain prices and prizes |
| 19:15–19:45 | Games 1–3 (1 line / 2 lines / full house each) |
| 19:45–20:00 | Break, snack upsell, social posts |
| 20:00–20:30 | Games 4–6 |
| 20:30–20:55 | Final “big” game |
| 20:55–21:00 | Prize settlement, float sign-off, thank-yous |

## Marketing (Responsibly)

- Focus messaging on community, atmosphere, and bundles—not guaranteed winnings.
- Channels: in-house posters, Facebook “What’s On” groups, pensioner lunch leaflets, WhatsApp broadcast to regulars.
- **Copy-ready caption:** “Cash Bingo this Thursday, eyes down 7.15pm 👀 Books from £1, prizes every game, Challenge 25 in operation. Reserve a table: [link].”

## Budget Snapshot

| Expense | Range |
| --- | --- |
| Bingo machine/board | £100–£400 purchase or hire |
| Tickets/dabbers | £15–£40 per 100 players |
| Prize kitty | Depends on entries (publish percentages) |
| Staff hours | Caller + verifier + FOH |

## Metrics to Track

| KPI | Target |

| Night pass uptake | 35%+ |
| Average spend per head | £16–£20 |
| Repeat attendance (4 weeks) | 50% |

Debrief the next day: Did any rules confuse people? Were payouts smooth? Do we need more dabbers? Capture feedback before the next session.

## FAQs

**Do I need a Gambling Commission licence to run bingo?** Not if you stay within the exempt equal-chance gaming rules (stakes ≤ £5/person/game and <£2,000 combined stakes/prizes over seven days) but you must document compliance.  
**How do I ensure I never exceed the £2,000 weekly limit?** Keep a running spreadsheet of every night’s takings and payouts; once you approach £1,600 pause cash bingo or switch to prize-based games until the rolling seven-day window resets.  
**What pricing structure works best?** Sell books rather than single tickets (£3 per book, £10 “night pass”) and publish exactly what each prize tier pays to avoid disputes.  
**How do I handle claims or disputes professionally?** Have a written protocol: pause calling, verify against the master sheet, record the outcome in the winners log, and communicate calmly over the mic.  
**Can I combine cash bingo with charity fundraising?** Yes—just keep charitable donations ring-fenced from stake money and be transparent about which games are for charity vs standard payout.
