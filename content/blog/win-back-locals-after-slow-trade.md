# How to Win Back Locals After Months of Slow Trade

When regulars drift away, it feels personal. In reality, people forget why they loved you or assume the pub lost its spark. The fix is a clear story, direct invitations, and a 30-day run of reasons to return.

## Step 1: Own the story

Share a short, honest update about what has changed. People support progress when you invite them in.

Example:
"We are back on track with a tighter menu and a new Thursday night rhythm. We would love you to see it."

## Step 2: Build a lapsed regulars list

Use booking notes, old email lists, and staff memory. Keep it simple and personal.

## Step 3: Send personal invitations

Do not blast a generic post. Send a short, friendly invitation to return.

Example:
"Hi Sam, we have missed you. We are running a locals night next Thursday and would love to reserve your table."

## Step 4: Create a 30-day drumbeat

Plan four weeks of visible activity:
- One locals night.
- One community collaboration.
- One new menu highlight.
- One small event.

This creates momentum and gives people reasons to return.

## Step 5: Celebrate their return

Make returning locals feel seen. A simple welcome, a reserved table, or a small thank you can reset loyalty fast.

## Step 6: Keep the loop alive

After they return, invite them again. Consistency is the real win-back strategy.

## Common mistakes

- Waiting for locals to return without outreach.
- Announcing big changes with no follow through.
- Running one event and stopping.

## Quick checklist

- Story update written.
- Lapsed list built.
- Personal invites sent.
- 30-day calendar set.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I offer discounts to win locals back?**
Small gestures are fine, but focus on recognition and experience, not price.

**How many times should I invite them?**
Two to three direct touch points over a month is enough.
