# How to Win Back Locals After Months of Slow Trade

When regulars drift away, the silence can feel personal. In reality, people move on because they forget why they loved you or assume the venue has lost its sparkle. The fix is proactive, honest communication coupled with a run of irresistible experiences.

## Step 1: Own the Story
Post a heartfelt update on social, email, and in-venue posters acknowledging the slow patch and explaining what is changing. People respect transparency. Invite feedback via a short survey and act on the top three suggestions publicly.

## Step 2: Build a Lapsed Regulars List
Export customers who have not booked or used their loyalty card in 90 days. Add locals who commented on old posts but have gone silent. This becomes your VIP reconnection list.

## Step 3: Send Personal Invitations
Split the list across managers and senior staff. Each person sends 10 personalised messages per day via WhatsApp, text, or handwritten cards. Include a specific date, the reason to visit, and a small loyalty perk (welcome cocktail, house dessert, reserved booth).

## Step 4: Create a 30-Day Drumbeat
Week 1: locals-only tasting night and a community forum in the snug.
Week 2: charity pub quiz supporting a nearby cause.
Week 3: collab menu with the bakery, featuring limited pastries before noon.
Week 4: Sunday roast takeover with live acoustic sets.

Announce all four dates upfront so people plan ahead.

## Step 5: Celebrate Their Return
When lapsed guests walk in, greet them by name, thank them publicly, and capture a quick testimonial or photo (with permission). Share these stories on social to show momentum.

## Step 6: Keep the Loop Alive
Follow up 24 hours after their visit asking for feedback and a quick Google review. Invite them to a private locals group (Facebook or WhatsApp) where they get first dibs on future events.

## Mini FAQ
**Should I discount heavily to tempt them back?**
No. Offer added value (exclusive menu, surprise course, personal thank-you) instead of slashing prices. Locals want to feel appreciated, not bargain hunted.

**What if some locals are negative online?**
Respond with empathy, outline what is changing, and invite them for a coffee to talk it through. Onlookers judge your professionalism, not the complaint itself.

Trust returns when you show up consistently and treat every guest like a VIP.
