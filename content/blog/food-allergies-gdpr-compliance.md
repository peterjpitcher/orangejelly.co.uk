# Food Allergies and GDPR: The Compliance Nightmares That Could Close You Down

Compliance is not exciting, but it is non-negotiable. Allergen mistakes and data breaches can shut a pub down. The good news is that simple systems prevent most problems.

This guide is practical, not legal advice. Always check the latest guidance and regulations.

## Part 1: Allergen safety system

**1) Build the master matrix**
Create a spreadsheet with every menu item and the 14 allergens. Update it whenever recipes change. Print and keep a copy in the kitchen and at the bar.

**2) Maintain an ingredient file**
Keep supplier spec sheets and product labels in one folder. Date each update.

**3) Create a clear service protocol**
Train staff to say: "Let me check." No guessing. Use a simple flow: order, check matrix, confirm with the kitchen, then confirm with the guest.

**4) Control cross-contamination**
Use separate boards and clear labeling for allergen-free prep. This is basic but vital.

## Part 2: GDPR basics for pubs

**1) Collect consent properly**
If you collect emails or phone numbers, you need clear opt-in. Avoid pre-ticked boxes.

**2) Store data securely**
Use password-protected systems. Limit who can access the list.

**3) Respond quickly to requests**
If someone asks for their data or wants to be removed, respond within 30 days.

**4) Keep data only as long as needed**
Regularly delete old, inactive records.

## Common mistakes

- Outdated allergen lists.
- Staff guessing answers.
- Collecting emails without consent.
- Sharing lists between personal devices.

## Quick checklist

- Allergen matrix updated and printed.
- Staff trained on the "let me check" rule.
- Consent form in place for emails.
- Data stored securely and reviewed quarterly.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need a lawyer?**
Not always, but professional advice can help if you are unsure about your responsibilities.

**How often should I update allergen info?**
Every time a recipe changes and at least quarterly.
