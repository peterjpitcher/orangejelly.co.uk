# Social Media Tactics That Drive Footfall in Seven Days

A single pretty post rarely changes trade. A short, tight sprint can. The goal is to fill specific seats on specific nights, not to chase likes.

This seven-day plan gives you a repeatable burst that turns social posts into bookings.

## Day 0: Prep

- Pick one event or offer.
- Set a booking link and a clear cap.
- Capture 10 photos and 5 short clips in one hour.

This prep day makes the rest easy.

## Days 1-2: Proof first

Post photos of the offer or the room. Use a clear CTA and availability.

Example: "Thursday steak night, 12 tables left. Book now."

## Days 3-4: Spotlight guests and staff

People show up for people. Share a short story, a regular quote, or a behind-the-scenes clip. Keep the CTA consistent.

## Day 5: Paid push

Spend a small amount on a targeted local ad. Even 20 pounds can move bookings if the offer is clear.

## Day 6: Partner or swap

Ask a local business to share your post. Swap posts or co-host. This adds reach without extra spend.

## Day 7: Countdown and close

Post remaining availability and a final call. Scarcity drives action.

## Asset checklist

- 10 photos (food, drinks, room, crowd).
- 5 short clips (10 to 15 seconds).
- One simple availability graphic.
- A booking link that works on mobile.

## What to track

- Booking link clicks.
- Messages about availability.
- Actual covers on the night.

## Common mistakes

- Changing the message every day.
- Posting without a booking link.
- Waiting until the day of the event.

## Quick checklist

- One offer chosen.
- Assets captured in one session.
- Seven-day schedule planned.
- Paid boost set for day 5.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need TikTok for this?**
No. One platform done well beats three done badly.

**How long should the sprint run?**
Seven days is enough to build urgency without fatigue.
