# Board Game Night 101: Formats, Libraries and Teaching That Win

Board game nights turn sleepy Mondays into steady revenue: long dwell times, relaxed rounds of food and drink, no stage tech required. This playbook covers formats, starter libraries, teaching scripts, room layout, marketing, metrics, and safeguarding.

## Why Board Game Nights Work

- **Low cost:** once you buy the games, you reuse them weekly.
- **Inclusive:** introverts, families, students, and “dry” guests can all join.
- **High dwell:** most tables stay 2–3 hours, ordering multiple rounds and platters.
- **Community-building:** leagues, ladders, and social media shout-outs keep people coming back.

## Pick a Format

| Format | Description | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open library | Guests borrow from your curated shelf | Casual Mondays, drop-ins |
| Learn-to-play table | Staff teaches one gateway game per week | New gamers, students |
| Tournament ladder | Structured bracket for 2-player games | Chess/cribbage clubs |
| Party pit | Fast, loud games (Codenames, Just One) | Work socials, hen/stag warm-ups |

Mix formats across the room so regulars can try something new without pressure.

## Curate a Starter Library

Aim for 20–25 titles covering different moods. Include classic pub games so older regulars feel at home.

| Category | Examples | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Party (10–20 mins) | Codenames, Linkee, Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza | 4–10 players, loud corners |
| Gateway strategy (45–60 mins) | Ticket to Ride Europe, Carcassonne, Azul, Splendor | Teach table features these |
| Two-player staples | Chess, draughts, Jaipur, Patchwork | Reserve quieter tables |
| Co-operative | Pandemic, Forbidden Island | Good for mixed groups |
| Pub classics | Shut the Box, cribbage, dominoes, darts ladder | Keep scoreboards handy |

Sleeve high-use card games, label every box with player count and approximate duration, and keep a parts-replacement list (meeples, dice, cards).

## Teaching Scripts (copy-ready)

Use a simple framework so team members can explain unfamiliar games:

1. **Goal in one sentence:** “In Ticket to Ride you’re scoring points by building train routes between cities.”
2. **Turn structure:** “On your turn you either draw cards, claim a route, or draw new tickets.”
3. **End condition:** “Game ends when someone has two or fewer trains; add route bonuses.”
4. **One gotcha:** “Remember, uncompleted tickets lose you points.”
5. **Start playing:** “Let’s take two practice turns together.”

Print these cues on A6 cards and keep them with each game.

## Space and Flow

- **Zones:** Classic Corner (cribbage/dominoes), Strategy Tables, Party Pit, Quiet Nook.
- **Signage:** “Looking for Players”, “Teach Me”, “Tournament Table”.
- **Lighting/music:** brighter than quiz night, playlists low enough for rule explanations.
- **Storage:** Kallax-style shelving labelled by category; returns trolley for pieces needing cleaning/drying.

## Run-of-Show (150 minutes)

| Time | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 18:30 | Doors, welcome, punch-card stamping |
| 18:40 | Warm-up challenge (e.g., Shut the Box quick-fire) |
| 19:00 | Play Block 1 (60 mins) |
| 20:00 | Break + table swap invitations |
| 20:10 | Play Block 2 (45 mins) |
| 20:55 | Leaderboard reveal, prize draw |
| 21:00 | Wrap, plug next week’s spotlight game |

## Community and Retention

- **Punch cards:** play five nights, get a limited enamel pin or free platter.
- **Leaderboard:** highlight teams that completed the most games or achieved “King of Carcassonne”.
- **Discord/WhatsApp group:** share teaches, vote for next spotlight, arrange off-site meetups.
- **Photo consent system:** opt-out stickers/wristbands for anyone who doesn’t want to appear on socials.

## Food and Drink Pairings

- **Table platters:** sausage rolls, scotch eggs, pickles (£12). Minimal cutlery so games stay clean.
- **Low-spill drinks:** tankards, cans, stemless wine glasses.
- **AF focus:** flight of 3 x 1/3 pints for designated drivers.
- **Bundle example:** “Meeples & Munchies” — platter + 2 drinks for £25, bookable with a table.

## Budget and Kit

| Item | Cost range |
| --- | --- |
| 20-game starter library | £150–£500 (mix of classics + modern titles) |
| Storage & signage | £80–£200 |
| Replacement parts fund | £20/month |
| Table coverings + cleaning kit | £40–£80 |

Encourage guests to donate games in exchange for bar credit, but vet condition and content first.

## Accessibility and Inclusion

- Provide colour-blind-friendly options (e.g., Catan base pieces with stickers, ticket overlays).
- Offer quiet tables away from party pit noise.
- Print large-type rule summaries and provide magnifying glasses for text-heavy games.
- Keep adaptive scissors or card holders handy for younger players or guests with dexterity challenges.

## Marketing Toolkit

- **Visuals:** overhead shots of colourful boards, “hands-in” moments.
- **Copy-ready caption:** “Board Game Night every Monday, 7pm. Library provided, teaches included, solo players welcome. Reserve a seat 👉 [link].”
- **Cross-promo:** tie into Quiz Night 101 (“Prefer tabletop strategy? Join us Mondays”), Music Bingo 101 (“Same crowd, different vibe”).
- **Community outreach:** drop flyers at local game shops, universities, community centres.

## Compliance & Housekeeping

Board game nights rarely trigger licensing requirements, but you should still:

- Keep walkways clear (fire safety).
- Wipe components with baby wipes/sanitiser between sessions.
- Log accidents/spills and replenish PPE (gloves, plasters) as part of daily closing.

## Metrics to Track

| KPI | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tables booked vs walk-ins | 70/30 split | Encourages advance planning without deterring spontaneous players. |
| Average dwell time | 2+ hours | Use booking logs or QR checkout form. |
| Food attachment rate | Strong | Add to till prompts. |
| Repeat attendance (6 weeks) | Strong | Monitor punch-card redemptions. |

Post-event, ask: Did we run out of specific games? Which teaches were requested? Should we rotate the spotlight title?

## FAQs

**How big should my starter library be?** Aim for 20–25 titles covering party, gateway strategy, two-player, co-op, and classic pub games; expect £150–£500 to get set up.  
**How do I stop pieces from going missing?** Label and zip-lock every component, keep a returns trolley for staff to check, and log damages so you can recharge deposits if needed.  
**Should I charge a cover fee?** Many pubs make it free but require a booking with food; if you charge, keep it under £5 and include a drink/snack voucher.  
**Do staff need to be gamers?** Not necessarily—give them one-minute teach cards so they can explain basics confidently and escalate deeper questions to a “games captain.”  
**What KPIs prove the night is working?** Track table bookings vs walk-ins, average dwell time, food attachment rate, and punch-card returns so you can evidence uplift to your area manager.
