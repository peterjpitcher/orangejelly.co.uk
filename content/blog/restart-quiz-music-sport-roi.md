# Restarting Your Quiz, Live Music, and Sport Nights for Maximum ROI

Entertainment nights can either cement loyalty or drain margin. Relaunch them with intention and they become a weekly anchor for revenue.

## Step 1: Build an 8-Week Calendar
Map quizzes, music, and sport fixtures so you never cannibalise your own nights. Alternate formats (general knowledge, pop culture, picture rounds) and genres (acoustic, covers, DJs) to keep things fresh.

## Step 2: Pre-Book Everything
Require free but refundable deposits via online booking. Allocate premium tables with minimum spends. Share table maps so guests know what they are buying.

## Step 3: Tier the Experience
Offer three levels:
- **Standard**: entry, table service.
- **Plus**: prime seating, sharer board, welcome drink.
- **VIP**: booth, host greeting, bespoke drinks tree.

## Step 4: Script Hosts and MCs
Give quizmasters and musicians a run sheet with upsell cues (interval snack specials, halftime shots). Pay them a flat fee plus bonus if sales targets are hit.

## Step 5: Maximise F&B
Create limited-time menus for each night (e.g. "Quiz Fuel" platters, "Matchday Towers"). Offer table-kegs or cocktail trees pre-ordered at booking. Use QR codes for easy round reorders.

## Step 6: Capture Data
Collect emails and phone numbers at booking. Post-event, send thank-you notes, request reviews, and promote next week's theme. Reward teams that return three times with merch or trophies.

## Mini FAQ
**What about licensing for music and sport?**
Ensure PRS/PPL fees are current and sports broadcasting rights are secured. Fines cost more than licences.

**How do I handle no-shows?**
Keep deposits for tables that do not arrive within 15 minutes unless they call ahead. Communicate this policy clearly when booking.

Well-structured entertainment nights keep tills ringing, bartenders busy, and locals bragging about their second home.
