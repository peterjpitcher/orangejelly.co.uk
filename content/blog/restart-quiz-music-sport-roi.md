# Restarting Your Quiz, Live Music, and Sport Nights for Maximum ROI

Entertainment nights can either anchor your week or drain your margins. The difference is structure. A relaunch works when it has a calendar, a booking system, and a clear path to profit.

Use this framework to bring back quiz, music, and sport nights with confidence.

## Step 1: Build an 8-week calendar

Map quiz, music, and sport nights across eight weeks so they do not cannibalise each other. Alternate formats and themes to keep regulars interested.

Example rotation:
- Week 1: quiz
- Week 2: live music
- Week 3: sport screening
- Week 4: quiz with a twist

Consistency builds habit.

## Step 2: Pre-book and pre-pay

Require a small deposit for premium tables. It increases commitment and smooths cashflow. Use a simple booking page or a phone list if needed.

## Step 3: Tier the experience

Create three levels so guests can choose their spend.

- Standard: entry and a basic seat.
- Plus: better seats and a shared board.
- VIP: best tables, a welcome drink, and a host check-in.

## Step 4: Script the hosts

Give quizmasters and MCs clear cues for upsells and announcements. A scripted host drives revenue more consistently than a casual one.

## Step 5: Maximise food and drink

Build a simple menu for each night. Use bundles, not discounts.

Examples:
- Quiz fuel platter.
- Matchday pitcher bundle.
- Live music tasting board.

## Step 6: Capture data and follow up

Collect emails or phone numbers at booking. Send a thank you message and promote the next night within 48 hours.

## Step 7: Measure the ROI

Track covers, spend per head, and margin for each format. Drop the weakest and double down on the strongest.

## Common mistakes

- Running too many formats at once.
- Letting guests walk in without a booking plan.
- Forgetting to promote the next night during the current one.

## Quick checklist

- 8-week calendar set.
- Booking system live.
- Tiered experience priced.
- Host script printed.
- Follow-up message prepared.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I run all three formats every week?**
No. Rotate them so each feels special and has space to grow.

**Do deposits scare people off?**
Small deposits usually increase commitment without reducing demand.
