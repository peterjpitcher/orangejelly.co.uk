# Fill Empty Seats: Proven Midweek Offers That Actually Convert

Quiet nights are rarely a mystery – they are a sign that the offer is confusing, invisible, or built around discounts that gut profit. Here is how to design midweek activity that sells out in advance and builds a waiting list instead of a shrug.

## Step 1: Start With Data, Not Guesswork
Pull six months of EPOS data and rank dishes and drinks by contribution per minute (high GP, quick to produce). Those become the building blocks of your offer. Avoid labour-heavy dishes that need the full brigade when you are trying to stay lean midweek.

## Step 2: Pick One Promise Per Night
- **Tuesday Sharer Club**: any three small plates plus bottle of Portuguese red for £30.
- **Wednesday Theme Night**: curry club, steak night, vegan takeover – but switch monthly so locals do not get bored.
- **Industry Wednesday After-Work**: half-price snacks for anyone showing hospitality ID before 7pm.

## Step 3: Pre-Book and Pre-Pay
Cap capacity (e.g. 40 covers) and sell time slots. Use simple tools: Eventbrite, Square appointments, or even Google Forms with bank transfer. Offer a £5 credit on the night for anyone paying in advance to reduce no-shows.

## Step 4: Stack Upsells
Train the team to upsell sharer boards to larger tables, add dessert tasters, or upgrade house beer to limited keg releases. Create a mini menu of add-ons printed on the booking confirmation so guests arrive already primed.

## Step 5: Promote in Tight Bursts
Seven-day campaign works best:
1. **Day 1** email the database with a bold subject line.
2. **Day 2** drop reels or raw TikTok of prep with chef commentary.
3. **Day 3** task staff to text their ten favourite guests.
4. **Day 4** run a £25 boosted geo ad, 3km radius, targeting foodies.
5. **Day 5** share behind-the-scenes marinade, tasting, or playlist builds.
6. **Day 6** publish the sold-out warning.
7. **Day 7** capture testimonials and put next week on sale immediately.

## Step 6: Measure Ruthlessly
Track covers, spend per head, GP per head, labour percentage, and booking lead time. If an offer misses targets twice, iterate – tweak the bundle, partner with a local brand, or move the night.

## Mini FAQ
**Do I always need a discount?**
No. Bundle perceived value (welcome drink, chef table chat, live acoustic set) instead of slashing price. Guests buy the experience, not pence off.

**What if I cannot take prepayments?**
Use deposit jars at the bar or take card-not-present payments over the phone. Even a £5 commitment halves the no-show rate.

Curated bundles plus disciplined marketing mean midweek becomes predictable instead of painful.
