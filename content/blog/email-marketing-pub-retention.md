# Email Marketing for Pubs: Build a Database That Drives Repeat Business

A great visit means nothing if you never see the guest again. Email gives you a direct way to bring people back without paying for ads every time. The key is to keep it simple and consistent.

## Step 1: Build the list the right way

Use opt-in forms, booking checkboxes, and in-pub QR cards. Do not buy lists. You want locals who actually visit.

## Step 2: Create a welcome sequence

A short welcome series sets expectations and drives the second visit.

- Email 1: thank you and a warm welcome.
- Email 2: highlight your signature offer.
- Email 3: invite them to a specific event.

## Step 3: Choose a weekly rhythm

Most pubs do well with one weekly email:
- Whats on this week.
- A simple offer.
- A clear booking link.

## Step 4: Segment lightly

You only need two or three segments:
- Regulars.
- Event attendees.
- Families or lunch guests.

Segmentation helps you keep messages relevant.

## Step 5: Measure the basics

Track:
- Open rate.
- Clicks to booking.
- Actual bookings.

If bookings rise, the email is working.

## 90-day plan

- Month 1: build the list and welcome series.
- Month 2: establish weekly rhythm.
- Month 3: segment and test two offers.

## Common mistakes

- Sending too many emails.
- No clear CTA.
- Writing long newsletters nobody finishes.

## Quick checklist

- Opt-in active in the pub and online.
- Welcome sequence written.
- Weekly email scheduled.
- Clicks and bookings tracked.

## Mini FAQ

**How big does the list need to be?**
Even 200 engaged locals can move a quiet night.

**Should I send discounts?**
Use added value or priority booking rather than constant discounts.
