# Email Marketing for Pubs: Build a Database That Drives Repeat Business

A customer walks into your pub, has a great meal, leaves happy... and you never see them again. Sound familiar? Here's the painful truth: the average pub loses 60% of first-time customers simply because they have no way to invite them back.

Meanwhile, a typical village pub in Cambridge sends a simple Tuesday email to their 3,000-strong list and fills every midweek table. Their secret? They turned email marketing from an afterthought into their most profitable marketing channel.

Email marketing returns £42 for every £1 spent – the highest ROI of any marketing channel. Yet most pubs either ignore it completely or blast out desperate "please visit us" messages that nobody reads. This guide shows you how to build an email system that turns occasional visitors into profitable regulars.

## Why Email Marketing Is Your Pub's Secret Weapon

The numbers tell the story:

- Email is 40x more effective than social media for customer acquisition

- 72% of consumers prefer email for business communication

- Repeat customers spend 67% more than new ones

- Email subscribers visit 2x more frequently than non-subscribers

But here's the real power: you own your email list. While social media algorithms change and paid ads get expensive, your email database remains your direct line to customers' inboxes.

## The Foundation: Building Your Email List

### The Value Exchange Principle

Nobody gives their email for nothing. You need irresistible offers that make signing up a no-brainer:

**Immediate Gratification Offers:**

- "Join our list, get a free drink on your next visit"

- "Sign up for 20% off your birthday meal"

- "Free dessert with your first email sign-up"

- "Exclusive happy hour prices for subscribers"

**Ongoing Value Propositions:**

- First access to event tickets

- Members-only tasting events

- Early bird Sunday roast bookings

- Secret menu items for subscribers

- VIP quiz team registration

### Collection Methods That Actually Work

**1. The WiFi Gateway**

Turn free WiFi into list-building gold:

- Require email for access

- Offer faster speeds for subscribers

- Send welcome email immediately

- Include first-visit incentive

*Example: a typical traditional pub built a 2,000-person list in 6 months using WiFi sign-ups with a "free coffee on your next visit" incentive.*

**2. The Table Talker**

QR codes on every table:

- "Scan for today's secret special"

- "Join for exclusive offers"

- "Rate your meal, get 10% off next time"

- "Birthday coming up? Get a free bottle of wine"

**3. The Receipt Request**

Train staff to ask at payment:

- "Would you like email receipts?"

- "Join our VIP list for exclusive offers?"

- "Get 10% off your next visit?"

- Make it part of service flow

**4. The Event Sign-Up**

Leverage busy times:

- Quiz night registration

- Live music mailing list

- Sunday roast booking alerts

- Special event early access

**5. The Social Media Bridge**

Convert followers to subscribers:

- Facebook sign-up forms

- Instagram bio links

- Story swipe-ups

- Contest entries

### GDPR Compliance Made Simple

Stay legal without complexity:

- Clear opt-in language

- Easy unsubscribe option

- Explain email frequency

- Store consent records

- Regular list cleaning

**Simple Consent Language:**

"We'd love to keep you updated with exclusive offers and events. We'll email you no more than once a week and you can unsubscribe anytime."

- "Why Tuesday nights just got interesting"

- "You're not going to believe what happened last night"

**Urgency/Scarcity:**

- "Only 3 Sunday roast slots left"

- "Tonight only: Half-price cocktails"

- "Last chance for Christmas bookings"

**Personal Touch:**

- "Happy birthday month, \[Name\]!"

**The Scannable Structure:**

- Bold key points

- Bullet main offers

- Single column layout

- One clear CTA per section

- Mobile-optimized images

**The Conversational Tone:**

Write like you talk:

- "Hey Sarah" not "Dear Valued Customer"

- "See you Friday?" not "We hope to see you soon"
