# Cash Flow Crisis Every Month? Breaking the Feast-or-Famine Cycle

The monthly panic is not just about revenue. It is about timing. Rent and wages come on fixed dates while income swings wildly. The fix is not a miracle week, it is a repeatable cash rhythm.

Here is a tighter, less chaotic system that builds a buffer over 90 days.

## Step 1: Build a weekly income architecture

Most pubs rely on weekend spikes. That creates risk. Build at least two reliable midweek anchors such as a set menu night and a recurring event. Predictability is more valuable than occasional peaks.

## Step 2: Reset payment timing

Where possible, align major outflows with your strongest inflows. Even small shifts in payment dates can smooth the month.

- Ask suppliers for fortnightly terms.
- Split rent into two smaller payments.
- Move payroll to align with higher cash weeks if possible.

## Step 3: Create a war chest

Aim for a small cash buffer equal to one week of fixed costs. Build it slowly by redirecting a fixed percentage of weekly profit.

It does not need to be huge. It needs to be consistent.

## Step 4: Protect gross profit relentlessly

When cash is tight, GP is everything. Audit top sellers, remove low-margin items, and train staff on upsells that protect margin.

## Step 5: Turn future demand into current cash

Deposits, gift cards, and prepaid experiences pull cash forward without discounting. Use them strategically during quieter months.

## Step 6: Run a 90-day plan

**Weeks 1 to 4**: fix the offer and build two midweek anchors.
**Weeks 5 to 8**: run one event per month with deposits.
**Weeks 9 to 12**: start building the buffer and review pricing.

## Common mistakes

- Chasing one big event instead of a weekly rhythm.
- Ignoring payment timing.
- Discounting instead of improving margin.

## Quick checklist

- Two midweek anchors planned.
- Payment dates reviewed.
- Buffer target set.
- Deposit offer live.

## Mini FAQ

**How long does it take to break the cycle?**
Most pubs see stability within three months if the rhythm is followed.

**What if trade drops again?**
The buffer and predictable midweek income reduce the shock.
