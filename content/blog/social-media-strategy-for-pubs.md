# The Complete Social Media Strategy Guide for Pubs in 2025

Social media works when it has a clear purpose: to bring people into the pub. That means fewer random posts and more consistent systems.

## Step 1: Define the goal

Decide what social media should drive: bookings, event attendance, or awareness. One primary goal keeps the content focused.

## Step 2: Assign platform roles

- Instagram: visuals and atmosphere.
- Facebook: events and community updates.
- TikTok: short, fun clips if you have the time.

Do not try to master all of them at once.

## Step 3: Build a simple calendar

A basic weekly rhythm is enough:
- Monday: whats on.
- Wednesday: story or staff highlight.
- Friday: social proof or event reminder.

## Step 4: Create a content workflow

Batch content once a week. Take photos during service and store them in a shared folder. This removes the daily stress.

## Step 5: Track results that matter

Track bookings, messages, and link clicks. Likes are useful only if they lead to visits.

## Common mistakes

- Posting without a clear CTA.
- Inconsistent schedules.
- Using only stock images.

## Quick checklist

- One main goal chosen.
- Platform roles defined.
- Weekly calendar in place.
- Booking link added to profiles.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need paid ads?**
Only if organic posts are working and you want to scale.

**How often should I post?**
Three times a week is enough if it is consistent.
