# Energy Bill Shock? Immediate Ways to Cut Venue Costs

Energy spikes can wipe out your profit in a single quarter. Here is how to get usage under control without turning the pub into an ice box.

## 1. Run a 7-Day Energy Audit
Log meter readings at open and close for a week. Note when peaks occur and which equipment was running. Use smart plugs or temporary monitors for cellars, kitchens, and accommodation if you have it. Data drives decisions.

## 2. Service the Workhorses
Fridges, cellar coolers, combi ovens, and glasswashers use the most power. Deep clean coils, descale, and check seals. A poorly sealed fridge door can add £300 per year alone.

## 3. Automate the Boring Stuff
Install timers or smart thermostats on exterior lighting, patio heaters, and HVAC. Program start-up and shut-down sequences so equipment only runs when needed. Use occupancy sensors for toilets and corridors.

## 4. Switch Tariffs Strategically
Gather 12 months of usage data and approach brokers for flexible contracts or group buying schemes (BBPA, NTIA, SIBA). Ask suppliers about load management or demand-side response incentives.

## 5. Engage the Team
Create a "Kill Switch" checklist for the close-down shift: lights, bar fridges, POS screens, extractors. Reward the crew when weekly usage drops below target. Appoint an "Energy Champion" to police rogue appliances.

## 6. Invest Where It Matters
- LED retrofit for the entire venue – payback in 6-9 months.
- Cellar fans with variable speed drives.
- Heat-reflective window film for south-facing glass.

Use grants or supplier financing where available.

## Mini FAQ
**Should I shut half the venue in winter?**
Zoning can help. Close rarely used rooms midweek, but make sure signage and staffing prevent guests feeling unwelcome.

**What about kitchen extract vs heating?**
Balance is key: reduce make-up air temperature gradually and fit auto-shut dampers so extract does not fight the heating overnight.

Energy control is not glamorous but every saved kilowatt-hour is margin that keeps the lights on for years to come.
