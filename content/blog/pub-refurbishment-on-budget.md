# Pub Refurbishment on a Budget: Transform Your Space for Under 5,000

A full refurb is not always possible, but a focused refresh can change how people feel about the pub. The goal is to improve first impressions, comfort, and atmosphere without breaking the bank.

## Phase 1: Quick wins (under 1,000)

- Deep clean the room and bar.
- Repaint one high-visibility wall.
- Upgrade lighting with warmer bulbs.

These changes give the biggest perception lift for the smallest spend.

## Phase 2: Comfort upgrades (1,000 to 2,500)

- Refresh seating with new pads or re-upholstery.
- Add simple soft furnishings like cushions and throws.
- Improve acoustics with rugs or wall panels.

Comfort drives dwell time and spend.

## Phase 3: Statement moments (2,500 to 5,000)

- Create one photo-worthy corner.
- Upgrade bar back display.
- Improve exterior signage and entrance.

A single statement area can change the entire perception of the pub.

## Where to avoid spending

- Fancy fixtures that guests never notice.
- Trendy decor that will feel dated quickly.
- Large refurb work without a clear return.

## Common mistakes

- Spreading budget too thin.
- Ignoring the entrance and toilets.
- Changing style without a clear plan.

## Quick checklist

- One high-visibility wall refreshed.
- Lighting upgraded.
- Seating made more comfortable.
- Entrance cleaned and improved.
