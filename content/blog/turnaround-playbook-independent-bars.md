# The Turnaround Playbook: How Independent Bars Bounce Back Fast

Every successful turnaround follows a rhythm: stabilise, reset, relaunch, then scale the habits. The mistake is trying to do everything at once. This playbook focuses the team on the right moves at the right time.

## Phase 1: Stabilise in 7 days

**Goal**: stop the bleed and create cash visibility.

- Build a 13-week cashflow.
- Triage costs into must pay, delay, and stop.
- Launch one cash-forward offer (deposits or gift cards).
- Set daily sales targets with the team.

**Key KPI**: daily cash position and covers per day.

## Phase 2: Reset the offer (Weeks 2 to 4)

**Goal**: simplify and make the offer clear.

- Choose one hero food offer and one drinks focus.
- Cost and price properly.
- Refresh the room for atmosphere.
- Train the team on scripts and upsells.

**Key KPI**: average spend per head and gross profit by category.

## Phase 3: Relaunch with proof (Weeks 5 to 8)

**Goal**: rebuild momentum and reputation.

- Launch one strong event.
- Capture reviews and social proof.
- Build a simple loyalty loop.
- Increase local outreach and partnerships.

**Key KPI**: bookings and repeat visits.

## Phase 4: Scale the habits (Weeks 9 to 12)

**Goal**: make the improvements repeatable.

- Document key processes.
- Create a weekly KPI dashboard.
- Lock the next 8-week calendar.
- Cross-train the team.

**Key KPI**: consistency week to week.

## Leadership behaviors that make it stick

- Share the numbers weekly.
- Celebrate small wins publicly.
- Keep the plan visible to the team.

## Common mistakes

- Jumping to marketing before fixing the offer.
- Cutting costs without a sales plan.
- Changing direction every week.

## Quick checklist

- Phase 1 actions completed.
- Offer reset live.
- One strong event launched.
- KPI board visible.

## Mini FAQ

Expect meaningful stability in 8 to 12 weeks if the plan is followed.

Only after the offer and cashflow are stable. Rebrands are expensive distractions.
