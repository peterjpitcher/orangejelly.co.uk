# The Turnaround Playbook: How Independent Bars Bounce Back Fast

There is a predictable rhythm to every successful turnaround. When I mentor landlords who feel overwhelmed, I remind them that the job is not to do everything at once – it is to move through four disciplined phases with ruthless focus.

## Phase 1: Stabilise in 7 Days
- **Cash clarity**: produce a 13-week rolling cashflow with daily bank checks.
- **Cost freeze**: pause discretionary spend, renegotiate utility direct debits, and shift supplier payments to weekly rather than COD.
- **Menu triage**: strip back to the 12 lines that actually sell; everything else leaves the building.
- **Communication**: tell staff, landlords, and key suppliers the plan so rumours do not derail morale.

## Phase 2: Reset the Offer (Weeks 2-4)
Use guest interviews, review data, and competitor walks to remap why people should choose you. Refresh the hero drinks list, rebuild a compact food menu around profitable crowd-pleasers, and redesign the shift pattern so superstars lead every peak session. Invest sweat equity, not capex: new chalkboards, playlist refresh, deep clean, and lighting tweaks go a long way.

## Phase 3: Relaunch With Proof (Weeks 5-8)
Plan three flagship moments: an event, an offer, and a cause. For example, a sold-out collaboration supper with the butcher, a locals-only tasting flight, and a fundraiser for the rugby minis. Capture social proof at each: photos, testimonials, pre-booking data. Push them across Meta, WhatsApp, in-venue screens, and table-talkers. The goal is to show the neighbourhood that the pub is charging forward, not clinging on.

## Phase 4: Scale the Habits (Weeks 9-12)
Turn every win into a playbook entry. Document open/close standards, upsell scripts, booking follow-up cadences, and event critical paths. Review numbers every Monday: sales mix, labour cost, GP, and guest feedback. Add only one new initiative per fortnight so the team can breathe.

## Leadership Behaviours That Make It Stick
- Hold daily stand-ups: 10 minutes, celebrate wins, set targets.
- Walk the floor with curiosity, not blame. Ask guests what felt different.
- Share the scoreboard visibly – a whiteboard behind the bar works just fine.
- Thank people publicly and coach privately.

## Mini FAQ
**Do I need outside investment first?**
Most independents do not; they need tighter focus and proof of demand. Investment comes once the scoreboard trends upwards.

**What if my landlord refuses to negotiate?**
Put the plan in writing, include sales projections, and show how stability protects their asset. Even stubborn landlords prefer a tenant with a plan over an empty unit.

Execute the phases in order, keep communication brutally honest, and the pub stops feeling like a runaway train.
