faqs:
  - question: "Do I need a TEN for a Friday pop-up?"
    answer: "If the trader serves similar food within your licensed hours you are covered. Apply for a Temporary Event Notice only when you extend hours or trade outside your licensed footprint, such as spilling into a car park."
  - question: "What happens if the trader cancels?"
    answer: "Keep a house-led Plan B like cheese-and-charcuterie boards or grazing platters ready. You can still honour bookings, keep the fizz bundle live, and switch the promo copy to a “house menu takeover” in minutes."
  - question: "How do I stop chaos between the pop-up and main kitchen?"
    answer: "Route every order through a single host who releases 10-minute collection windows. That way, chefs see consolidated tickets and the trader never floods the pass."
  - question: "Can suppliers contribute to the night?"
    answer: "Yes—ask prosecco or mixer reps for POS, glassware, or an opening case in exchange for tagging them in reels and calling out their brand within the bundle description."

# Friday Fizz or Street-Food Pop-Up Playbook

Friday is where the week either drifts into nothing or becomes the start of a huge weekend. A single trader partnership plus a fizz-led bundle keeps tills ringing while the kitchen preps for Saturday. Here’s the plug-and-play format we roll out for clients who need a lift without a full refit.

## Quick Win Snapshot
- **Prep time:** 3–4 hours total (menu sign-off, layout sketch, staff brief)
- **Target headcount:** 60–90 covers in two waves (after-work + early evening)
- **Margin maths:** £15–£18 bundle (small plate + spritz/AF serve) with 68–72% GP when shared with a trader on a 60/40 split
- **Ops focus:** Station near the pass or consider an outdoor gazebo; one team member on host, another floating drinks QR orders

## Pick a Format (Choose One and Stick for a Month)

| Format | What it looks like | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fizz Flight Station** | Trader serves three bite plates (e.g., arancini, bao, tacos) matched with fizz/spritz tasting flight | City centre, high female skew, Instagram crowds |
| **Street-Food Takeover** | Guest chef uses your kitchen for 4× plated dishes, you handle drinks/puddings | When you’ve spare prep time between lunch & dinner |
| **Courtyard Vendor Row** | One trailer parked outside + Aperol/AF spritz bar, standing tables | Wet-led pubs with limited kitchen capacity |
| **Community Collab** | Local bakery, deli, or farm shop co-creates a “Friday hamper” served on boards | Villages/market towns with strong local supplier loyalty |

Rotate formats quarterly, not weekly. Consistency wins.

## Partner Checklist (Copy-Paste into Your Outreach Email)
1. **Menu scope:** 4 items max, priced as part of a fixed bundle. Include an AF dish and one vegan option.
2. **Cost split:** Either wholesale their dishes and keep 100% of sales, or run a 60/40 till split (you keep the drinks, they keep food minus a service fee).
3. **Branding:** Agree on co-branded table talkers + social tiles. You supply the spritz stack (house prosecco, premium mixer, AF sparkling).
4. **Timeline:** Confirm menus by Monday, film prep clips by Wednesday, final headcount + delivery time by Thursday 3pm.
5. **Paperwork:** Copy of their public liability insurance, EHO rating screenshot, allergen sheet in your folder.

## Pricing and Bundles
- **Hero bundle:** “£18 Small Plate + Spritz” or “£15 Plate + AF Spritz.” Include a £1 upgrade for premium top-ups.
- **Add-on:** £5 dessert bite (mini cannoli / churros / brownie) from your kitchen so you still show off your menu.
- **Retail tie-in:** Sell bottled cocktails or premix spritz kits to-go at £20 so guests take the vibe home.

### Simple GP Formula
`(Plate Cost + Spritz Cost + Labour Uplift) ÷ Desired GP% = Bundle Price`. Keep labour uplift at £1.20–£1.50 per plate to cover the extra host.

## 90-Minute Run-Sheet (Per Wave)
| Time | Action |
| --- | --- |
| T-60 | Trader set-up, power check, glassware polish, playlist switch |
| T-30 | Staff briefing, allergen recap, soft-launch story on Instagram |
| 00:00 | First arrivals greeted with tasters, host explains “order at QR or bar” |
| 00:15 | Push bundle cards at tables, capture UGC shots |
| 00:45 | Tray service to outdoor tables, check stock, post mid-event reel |
| 01:20 | Last-call cue with “book next week” CTA |
| 01:30 | Quick survey QR drop, log sales + feedback |

## Marketing & Copy Blocks
- **Email subject:** “This Friday: Bao & Blood Orange Spritz — 60 seats only.”
- **Caption template:** “Friday Fizz Pop-Up • 5–8pm • Guest trader @handle • £18 plate + spritz (AF option) • Book via link.”
- **Community Love:** Tag the trader, local market, plus tourism accounts; offer two comp bundles for micro influencers who cover the night.
- **In-pub signage:** Clipboards with bundle photo + QR. Place at bar line and bathrooms by Wednesday.

## Ops, Compliance, and Service Tips
- Keep the trader’s kit outside the main kitchen to avoid cross-contamination. Use portable induction hobs or plan for cold service boards.
- Log allergens yourself, do not rely on “see trader.” Provide laminated cheat-sheets at the till.
- Separate till buttons for Bundle vs À la carte so you can see actual uptake.
- If licensing covers only your staff serving alcohol, station a team member next to any fizz taps that the trader touches.
- Post-event deep clean the borrowed area immediately; send trader a thank-you + next open date within 12 hours.

## Metrics to Track
| KPI | Target | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bundle uptake | 70% of orders | Till mix report |
| Incremental spend/head | +£6 vs standard Friday 5–8pm | Compare POS vs last four Fridays |
| New faces vs regulars | 40% new | Booking form tag |
| Social reach | 3× usual Friday story views | Instagram insights |

## Mini FAQ
**Do I need a TEN?** If the trader cooks similar food and you’re within normal hours, no. Need a TEN only if trading outside licensed hours or using outdoor space beyond your plan.

**What if the trader bails?** Always keep a house-led “Plan B” board (cheese + charcuterie) so you can still honour bookings with a fizz bundle.

**How do I keep service aligned with the main kitchen?** Stagger pop-up pick-up times with 10-minute windows and route all orders through a single host so chefs see consolidated tickets.

**How can I involve suppliers?** Ask your prosecco or mixer rep for POS, free stock, or comp glasses in exchange for tagging them in reels and featuring their pour in the bundle description.

Nail one format, promote it like a weekly ritual, and Friday pop-ups become the reason locals clock off early to see you first.
