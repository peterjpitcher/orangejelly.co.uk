# Survive the Off-Season: Packages That Keep Revenue Coming

When tourists hibernate and staycations slow, the bills keep landing. Rather than waiting for spring, design purposeful packages that turn your venue into the local HQ for meetings, parties, and hobbies.

## Step 1: Pick Three Core Segments
1. **Local Businesses** – team meetings, training days, client lunches.
2. **Family & Life Events** – christenings, milestone birthdays, post-funeral gatherings.
3. **Clubs & Communities** – running clubs, craft circles, gaming groups.

Each segment has predictable needs. Build offers once, sell them repeatedly.

## Step 2: Build Plug-and-Play Packages
Example corporate half-day:
- Private snug 9am-1pm
- Unlimited tea, filter coffee, pastries
- Projector, flipchart, Wi-Fi
- Lunch platters
- £25 per head, minimum 10

Example family celebration:
- Reserved section for 30
- Welcome fizz, buffet of five dishes, dessert table
- Kids craft corner hosted by team member
- £22 per adult, £10 per child

Example club night:
- Set night each week
- Pitcher and sharer combo pricing
- Storage for equipment
- Loyalty stamps leading to free room hire

## Step 3: Create Sales Collateral
Design a two-page PDF per package with photos, pricing, and testimonials. Upload to the website, print for the bar, and attach to every enquiry reply. Clarity sells faster than bespoke quotes.

## Step 4: Prospect Proactively
- DM local agencies, accountants, gyms, and PTAs with your corporate/family offers.
- Attend chamber of commerce breakfasts and leave with three follow-up meetings booked.
- Post in community Facebook groups highlighting the club night benefits.

## Step 5: Overdeliver and Upsell
Assign a host to every package booking. Offer extras such as photographer partnerships, live music, dessert carts, or branded cocktails. Turn satisfied hosts into referrers with a thank-you voucher for their next personal event.

## Mini FAQ
**Should I discount heavily midwinter?**
Lead with value (inclusions, exclusive use, set-up support) not slashed prices. Offer weekday incentives only if capacity remains low.

**Do I need new licences for hosted experiences?**
Most add-ons (craft tutors, yoga) just require clear risk assessments. Check PRS/PPL if adding new music elements.

Well-structured packages turn a bleak calendar into steady, predictable income.
