# Survive the Off-Season: Packages That Keep Revenue Coming

When tourist footfall drops, you need locally anchored packages that give people a reason to book. Packages work because they are easy to say yes to and easy to sell.

Here is a simple structure that keeps revenue coming in the quiet months.

## Step 1: Pick three core segments

Choose the three groups you can realistically serve:
- Local businesses.
- Community groups.
- Families and clubs.

Do not try to serve everyone.

## Step 2: Build plug-and-play packages

Keep packages simple and priced for margin.

Examples:
- "Team lunch" package: fixed menu plus room hire.
- "Community night" package: buffet plus quiz or speaker.
- "Family Sunday" package: roast plus kids activity.

## Step 3: Create simple sales collateral

A one-page PDF and a short message template are enough. The goal is clarity, not design awards.

## Step 4: Prospect proactively

Reach out directly to local businesses and groups. One phone call can fill a quiet week.

## Step 5: Overdeliver and upsell

Add a small extra that makes the experience feel special: welcome drinks, table signage, or a thank you email with a rebook offer.

## Common mistakes

- Overcomplicating packages.
- Pricing too low.
- Waiting for enquiries instead of outreach.

## Quick checklist

- Three segments chosen.
- Two packages built and priced.
- One-page collateral ready.
- Outreach list created.

## Mini FAQ

**How far ahead should I sell packages?**
Four to eight weeks. Early outreach beats last-minute panic.

**Should I discount to win corporate bookings?**
Not usually. Offer value through a clear package instead.
