# Karaoke Night 101: Plan, Host and Grow a Singalong Hit

Karaoke is still the cheapest way to pack a Thursday. Give regulars the mic, capture TikTok-friendly content, sell bundles while they wait to sing, and you’ve got a repeatable anchor night. This guide covers formats, equipment, hygiene, queue management, marketing, safeguarding, and compliance.

## Format Options

| Format | When to use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open mic rota | Most weeknights | Continuous queue; works for mixed crowds. |
| Showcase sets | Busy Fridays | Three themed blocks (e.g., Girl Bands vs Boy Bands) with breaks in between. |
| Team karaoke | Corporate/community bookings | Groups compete with judges or crowd voting. |
| Random wheel | Students/hen nights | Spin for surprise song; keep host ready with veto list. |

Decide whether the host also sings to warm the room—great in quieter periods, less necessary when you’ve already got a queue.

## Equipment and Sound

| Item | Spec | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microphones | 2x dynamic wireless + 1 wired backup | Wireless lets singers move; wired backup saves the night. |
| Mixer/audio interface | 4+ channels with EQ and reverb | Balance backing track vs vocals. |
| Speakers/monitor | FOH + wedge monitor or in-ears | Prevent feedback, help singers pitch. |
| Playback device | Laptop/tablet with licensed karaoke software (e.g., KaraFun Business) | Instant key changes, large catalogue, offline playlists. |
| Display | TV/projector with HDMI | Lyrics visible from anywhere. |
| Lighting | Simple LED bars or par cans | Creates stage vibe without blowing budget. |
| Hygiene kit | Disposable mic covers, wipes, hand gel | Swap covers every singer; wipe stands hourly. |

Before doors open, run a full soundcheck with your loudest backing tracks and quietest singers to set conservative gain levels. Add light reverb so vocals sit with the track but keep it subtle.

## Songbooks and Discovery

- Host a digital catalogue: QR code on every table linking to a searchable sheet sorted by artist, decade, difficulty.
- Print a “good first songs” list (Wonderwall, Valerie, Proud Mary, Mr Brightside) for nervous newbies.
- Curate rotating playlists (00s Week, Pride Playlist, Brit Awards special) and announce themes ahead of time to drive bookings.

## Queue Management and Stagecraft

1. **Sign-ups:** Use slips or a QR form capturing name, song, key change, duet request. Display the running order on TV so nobody feels skipped.
2. **Time limits:** Cap songs at 3m30s; fade gracefully if someone goes long.
3. **Rotation fairness:** Alternate between newcomers and regulars; allow one song per person per round.
4. **Host patter:** 10–15 second intro, highlight celebratory moments (birthdays, hen dos), and remind the crowd to cheer.
5. **Stage rules:** No swinging mics, drinks stay off stage, escorts for kids if you run daytime family karaoke.

## Safety, Inclusivity and Accessibility

- **Volume control:** Keep peaks below 95 dB; offer earplugs; provide a quiet area.
- **Content filter:** Keep a “red list” of songs with slurs/explicit lyrics you don’t allow. Host retains veto rights.
- **Photo consent:** Use wristbands or sticker system for guests who don’t want to be filmed; mention on the mic before filming.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure lyric screens are visible from multiple angles; provide a printed lyrics option; create stage ramps or alternative performance spaces for wheelchair users.

## Run-of-Show (120 Minutes)

| Time | Segment | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20:00–20:10 | Warm-up + sign-ups | Host sings one song, explains rules, pushes queue-skip bundle. |
| 20:10–20:50 | Set 1 | 10–12 singers; mix confident regulars with first-timers. |
| 20:50–21:00 | Break | Bar push (singer spritz, AF slushie), swap mic covers. |
| 21:00–21:40 | Set 2 | Encourage duets, group songs, birthday serenades. |
| 21:40–21:55 | “Greatest Hits” finale | Crowd-pleasers, audience singalongs, final prizes. |
| 21:55–22:00 | Wrap | Thank-you, winners photo, tease next theme, invite bookings. |

## Marketing Toolkit

- **Visuals:** neon typography, mic silhouettes, lyric overlays.
- **Content ideas:** Reel of crowd chorus (with consent), “Song of the Week” poll, behind-the-scenes soundcheck snippet.
- **Copy-ready caption:** “Karaoke Friday, 8pm. Free to sing, prizes for biggest crowd reaction. Book a table or just rock up—link in bio.”
- **Cross-promo:** plug Music Bingo 101 for midweek fun and Quiz Night 101 for trivia lovers.

## Compliance Corner: Music Licensing

Karaoke involves both recorded backing tracks and live vocal performance. Most venues cover this via **TheMusicLicence** (PPL PRS), which bundles permissions from PRS for Music and PPL. Confirm your venue’s licence type covers karaoke/live events and keep evidence on file. More info: [PPL PRS live events](https://pplprs.co.uk/themusiclicence/sectors/live-events-festivals/).

## FAQs

**What’s the minimum equipment investment to start?** Budget £300–£600 for two decent dynamic mics, a small mixer/interface, karaoke software, and basic lighting; hire gear short-term if you need to prove ROI first.  
**How do I keep the queue fair without annoying regulars?** Use a visible running order (TV/whiteboard) and rotate newcomers between established singers; cap it at one song per person per round.  
**Do I need extra licences or insurance?** Karaoke falls under TheMusicLicence for most venues, but check your public liability insurance covers live participation and that your licence includes live/recorded music.  
**How do I handle offensive or explicit lyric requests?** Keep a banned-song list, brief hosts to veto anything that breaches your safe-space policy, and offer clean alternatives.  
**What’s my contingency if the tech fails mid-show?** Always have a wired backup mic, offline playlists, and a Bluetooth speaker ready so you can pivot to a singalong or playlist battle while troubleshooting.
