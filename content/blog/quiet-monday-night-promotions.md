# Monday Night Pub Promotions That Actually Work (Not Another Quiz Night)

Monday is hard because people are tired, cautious with money, and not looking for loud nights. The solution is not to copy Friday. The solution is to create a low-friction reason to visit.

## The Monday rule: keep it simple

Monday promotions need to be easy to join and easy to run. If it feels like effort, guests will stay home.

## Four formats that actually work

**1) Comfort menu night**
A simple, value-led dish with a clear price. Think pie night, curry night, or a roast leftover special.

**2) Community club night**
Host a local club or group in the pub. You provide the space, they bring the audience.

**3) Low-key entertainment**
Board games, acoustic sessions, or gentle quiz formats. Keep it relaxed, not loud.

**4) Early week treat**
A small indulgence offer, like dessert and coffee bundles or a wine pairing.

## Marketing rhythm

- Post once on Sunday night as a reminder.
- Post again Monday lunchtime with availability.
- Ask staff to mention it at the bar.

## Common mistakes

- Creating a complex event on a low energy night.
- Discounting too heavily.
- Promoting once and forgetting.

## Quick checklist

- One Monday format chosen.
- Offer priced and costed.
- Team trained on the script.
- Two posts scheduled.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I run a quiz on Monday?**
Only if your audience already wants it. Do not force it.

**How long before Monday improves?**
Give it four to six weeks of consistency.
