# Music Bingo 101: Cards, Playlists, Hosting and Prizes

Swap numbers for nostalgia, and you’ve got the easiest crowd-pleaser in your events calendar. Music bingo lets guests mark off song titles instead of digits, meaning zero marking for staff, plenty of singalongs, and a format you can theme endlessly. This guide covers card creation, playlists, run-sheets, prizes, marketing, accessibility, and compliance so you can launch within a week.

## Choose Your Theme and Audience Fit

Music bingo thrives when the soundtrack matches your crowd and timeslot.

- **After-work Aperitivo (Thursdays):** 80s synth, Britpop, indie disco.
- **Family Sunday:** Disney bangers, musical theatre, film soundtracks.
- **Student night:** TikTok viral hits, 00s R&B throwbacks.
- **Seasonal specials:** Festive classics, Eurovision history, Pride anthems.

Rotate the headline theme every fortnight but keep a consistent night/time so regulars know when to return.

## Card Creation (Analogue and Digital)

Most venues keep it tactile with printed cards—simple 5×5 grids containing song titles or artists. Aim for 40–60 unique cards per theme so neighbouring tables don’t duplicate.

1. Build a master tracklist of 60–80 songs in a spreadsheet.
2. Randomise the order using `=RAND()` and distribute evenly across grids.
3. Label each card (A01, A02…) so winners are easy to verify.
4. Print on 160gsm paper for durability; laminate if you plan to reuse with dry-wipe pens.

**Digital option:** tools like MyFreeBingoCards or Bingo Baker allow QR-access cards. Great for hybrid events, but ensure Wi-Fi is stable and provide a few printed backups for guests who prefer paper.

## Playlist and Cue Crafting

- **Clip length:** 15–25 seconds is plenty—long enough for recognition, short enough to keep momentum.
- **Transitions:** preload the playlist in Spotify/Apple Music/DJ software with 2-second crossfades to avoid dead air.
- **Host cues:** before each clip ask, “Markers ready?” and after each track state “That was *Freed from Desire* by Gala—mark it if it’s on your card.” This helps guests who didn’t recognise the song by ear.

### Theme rotation idea

| Week | Theme | Anchor tracks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 90s Dancefloor Fillers | Gala, Livin’ Joy, Faithless |
| 2 | British Icons | Oasis, Amy Winehouse, Stormzy |
| 3 | Movie Night | Guardians mix, Dirty Dancing, Barbie |
| 4 | Girl Bands vs Boy Bands | Little Mix, Westlife, Sugababes |

## Rules and Rounds

A standard night runs three games of increasing stakes:

1. **Game 1:** One line (horizontal/vertical). Small prize.
2. **Game 2:** Two lines. Slightly larger prize.
3. **Game 3:** Full house. Main prize.

Winners shout “BINGO!”—host pauses music, verifies card versus the master list, and restarts after a quick photo.

**Tie-break suggestion:** keep a spare “guess the intro” clip. First player to name artist and title wins.

## Hosting and Energy

- Keep patter short and upbeat. Think “singalong MC” rather than stand-up comic.
- Encourage table choreography (claps, napkin waves). Offer a bonus drink token for the best dance move caught on stories.
- Use a winners board or Polaroid line so returning guests feel part of the club.

## Run-of-Show (90 Minutes)

| Time | Action | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 00:00–00:05 | Welcome & rules | Explain how to mark cards, demonstrate dabber use, highlight prizes. |
| 00:05–00:30 | Game 1 | 25 tracks; award single-line and double-line prizes. |
| 00:30–00:40 | Break | Push sharing plates, capture Reel, trail next theme. |
| 00:40–01:05 | Game 2 | Switch playlist to keep energy up; offer optional “dance-off” bonus. |
| 01:05–01:10 | Encore mini-game | First to guess three intros wins shot/AF mocktail tokens. |
| 01:10–01:15 | Game 3 finale & wrap | Full house prize, group photo, plug bookings. |

## Kit and Setup

| Item | Why | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Laptop/tablet | Playlist + master tracklist | Download playlists offline. |
| PA/speaker + mic | Keep energy high | Test speech vs music volume pre-doors. |
| Printed cards/dabbers | Core mechanic | Colour-code by game to avoid mix-ups. |
| Prize stash | Lines + full house | Include non-alcoholic options. |
| Float / card reader | Optional entry fee or bundles | Mark all sales through the till for reporting. |

**Budget snapshot:** £30–£60 printing, £50–£150 prizes, optional host fee £100–£250, plus staff hours.

## Marketing Playbook

- **Visual identity:** retro gradients, big typography (“Sing. Mark. Win.”).
- **Teasers:** ask followers to guess three blurred song titles for a free entry.
- **Copy-ready caption:** “Music Bingo drops Thursday 7.30pm 🎶 Free to play, prizes every round, bookings recommended 👉 [link].”
- **Day-of stories:** show card stacks, dabbers lined up, playlist screenshot.

## Accessibility and Inclusion

- Offer large-print cards and pens with chunky grips.
- Provide a printed list of songs played after each round so deaf or hard-of-hearing guests can check their cards.
- Keep a few tables closer to the speakers for those who rely on audio cues, while offering low-volume corners for sensory-sensitive guests.

## Compliance Corner

Music bingo uses recorded tracks, so ensure your venue holds **TheMusicLicence** (PPL PRS) covering public performance of recorded music. If you charge for entry or offer cash-equivalent prizes, check local licensing guidance to confirm you’re running a promotional activity rather than regulated gambling. Useful starting points: [PPL PRS](https://pplprs.co.uk/themusiclicence/) and [Gambling Commission guidance](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-to-licensing-authorities/part-18-bingo-in-clubs-and-alcohol-licensed-premises).

## Metrics to Track

| KPI | Target | How to capture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cards issued | 90% of available seats | Count per game. |
| Bundle uptake | 50% of tables | Use till buttons. |
| Social tags | +10 posts per night | Re-share to encourage more. |
| Repeat attendance | 60% within 4 weeks | Quick QR survey or booking log. |

Ask the team the next morning: Which tracks landed? Did we run out of dabbers? Did the break feel long enough? Capture ideas for next week’s theme.

## FAQs

**How many unique cards and tracks do I really need?** For a 60-person room plan 40–60 distinct cards and a 60–80 track playlist; reuse the template but reshuffle for each theme.  
**Do I need an extra licence beyond my existing music licence?** Usually TheMusicLicence (PPL PRS) covers music bingo, but double-check your account includes recorded music for events and keep proof on file.  
**Can I run it with just one staff member?** Ideally have a host/MC plus a floor runner to verify wins and push bundles; solo hosting works only in very small venues.  
**What’s the best way to monetise if entry is free?** Promote pre-booked tables with sharer platters, sell “dabber + drink” bundles, and capture emails for future promotions.  
**How often should I rotate themes?** Change the headline theme every 2–3 weeks so regulars feel variety without forcing you to rebuild assets weekly.
