# How to Run Successful Pub Events: A Complete Guide to Profitable Functions

Events work when they are treated like a product, not a one-off idea. The formula is simple: clear concept, tight pricing, focused promotion, and a smooth run sheet.

## Step 1: Choose the right concept

Pick one event that fits your audience and your team. The best events are repeatable and easy to explain.

Examples: quiz night, tasting board, live music, or a local partner takeover.

## Step 2: Build the pricing model

Use a fixed price or deposit to secure attendance. Add one upsell to protect margin.

## Step 3: Promote early and consistently

Start promotion three to four weeks ahead. Use the same message and booking link across all channels.

## Step 4: Run the night with a script

A simple run sheet keeps the event smooth. Include:
- Welcome moment.
- Key announcements.
- Upsell cues.
- Final call to book the next event.

## Step 5: Follow up within 48 hours

Send a thank you message and invite guests to the next event. This is where repeat bookings come from.

## Common mistakes

- Leaving booking open-ended.
- Promoting once and stopping.
- Overcomplicating the event format.

## Quick checklist

- Concept chosen and priced.
- Booking link live.
- Run sheet printed.
- Follow-up message scheduled.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need a big budget to run events?**
No. Small, repeatable events often outperform expensive one-offs.

**How often should I run events?**
Consistency matters more than volume. One strong event per week can be enough.
