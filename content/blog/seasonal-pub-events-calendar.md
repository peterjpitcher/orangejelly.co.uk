# Seasonal Pub Events Calendar: Year-Round Ideas That Drive Revenue

The calendar only feels quiet if you treat it that way. The easiest way to build steady trade is to plan by quarter, then pick one or two strong moments per month.

This is a simplified seasonal plan that avoids idea overload.

## Q1: January to March (reset and recovery)

- Dry January mocktail nights and wellness brunches.
- Burns Night supper with a fixed menu.
- Valentines or Galentines packages.
- Six Nations viewing with table deposits.

Focus on comfort and community after the festive rush.

## Q2: April to June (momentum and outdoor energy)

- Easter family events.
- Early summer garden launch.
- Bank holiday specials with live music or markets.

This quarter is about rebuilding energy and footfall.

## Q3: July to September (peak summer)

- Garden parties and BBQ evenings.
- Sports screenings with bundles.
- Local festival tie-ins.

Keep the format repeatable so the team can deliver every week.

## Q4: October to December (build to Christmas)

- Halloween events.
- Bonfire night warm-up.
- Christmas party packages and daytime groups.

Book early and cap capacity to protect service.

## How to choose the right events

Use three filters:
- Does it match your audience?
- Can you deliver it without extra stress?
- Can you repeat it next year?

## Common mistakes

- Planning too many events.
- Launching without a booking plan.
- Ignoring daytime opportunities.

## Quick checklist

- One event chosen per month.
- Booking links live.
- Calendar published on socials and in the pub.

You only need the next quarter locked in. Review every three months.

**How far ahead should I promote?**
Four to six weeks for most events, longer for Christmas.
