# Rescue Your Margins: The Drinks Mix That Keeps Money in the Till

A pub can be busy and still broke if the mix is wrong. The fastest margin win is not selling more drinks, it is selling the right drinks and removing the dead weight.

Use this framework to rebuild your drinks mix in one focused week.

## Step 1: Map the current mix

Pull a sales report and split your drinks into three tiers:
- High margin and high volume.
- High margin but low volume.
- Low margin and low volume.

The last group is your first target.

## Step 2: Build a three-tier ladder

Every category should have a clear ladder:
- Entry option.
- Mid option.
- Premium option.

This makes upselling natural and keeps price-sensitive guests comfortable.

## Step 3: Reprice with confidence

Check your GP targets and reset pricing where necessary. Small increases on high-volume items can stabilise margin without noticeable pushback.

## Step 4: Train the team on round crafting

Script three swaps that lift margin:
- House gin to premium gin.
- Standard lager to local craft.
- Single to double with a mixer.

Practice these daily for one week.

## Step 5: Partner with suppliers smartly

Ask for training, POS material, or a small activation in return for range commitment. Suppliers want you to sell more and will support if you ask.

## Step 6: Design menus that sell for you

Put premium options where eyes land. Use short descriptors. People buy the story as much as the drink.

## Common mistakes

- Keeping too many slow-moving lines.
- Pricing premium items too low.
- Relying on staff memory instead of menu cues.

## Quick checklist

- Drinks list segmented into three tiers.
- Slow movers removed.
- Premium ladder visible on the menu.
- Team trained on three swaps.

## Mini FAQ

**Will removing products upset regulars?**
Replace, do not remove. Offer a clear alternative and explain why it is better.

**How often should I review the mix?**
Monthly for fast-moving items, quarterly for the full list.
