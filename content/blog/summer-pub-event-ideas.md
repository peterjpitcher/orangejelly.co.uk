# Summer Pub Event Ideas: 35 Profitable Outdoor Promotions That Pack Your Garden

Summer events work when they are simple, repeatable, and easy to explain. Instead of 35 random ideas, use these four categories and pick the strongest from each.

## Category 1: Garden parties and socials

- Weekly garden party with a fixed drinks bundle.

- Team challenges with small prizes.

## Category 4: Family and community days

- Kids craft mornings.
- Local market stalls.
- Charity BBQs.

## How to choose the right summer event

Use these filters:
- Does it work in bad weather?
- Can the team deliver it weekly?
- Does it create a clear spend per head?

## Common mistakes

- One-off big events without follow-up.
- Overcomplicated menus in peak heat.
- No plan for rain.
