# Harnessing Delivery and Click & Collect Without Killing Service

Delivery can add revenue, but it can also crush the in-house experience if you let it run unchecked. The answer is not to drop the channel, it is to control it with a menu split, capacity cap, and clean handoff.

This is a practical system you can implement in a week.

## Step 1: Separate menus by channel

Your dine-in menu and delivery menu are not the same. Delivery needs:
- Dishes that travel well.
- Short prep time.
- Strong margins after fees.

Create a short delivery menu and keep it stable for four weeks. It will lift consistency and ratings.

## Step 2: Ringfence capacity

Decide how many delivery orders you can handle per hour without hurting tables. Then cap it. Most platforms let you pause or throttle.

If you do not cap, the kitchen gets crushed, and everyone loses.

## Step 3: Create a dispatch station

Build a clean, labeled area for packing, checks, and pickup. The person on dispatch is responsible for accuracy, extras, and timing.

A single missed sauce can undo a good meal.

## Step 4: Optimize collection flow

Click and collect should be fast. Clear signage, a dedicated pick-up point, and a one-minute handover keeps it smooth.

If guests have to queue at the bar, you are creating friction.

## Step 5: Track profit per channel

Compare delivery margin to dine-in margin. If delivery is below your threshold, raise prices or reduce items. You are not here to sell at a loss.

## Step 6: Cross-pollinate marketing

Use delivery customers to build dine-in visits. Add a card in every bag: "Show this and get priority booking." It is a simple bridge from takeout to table.

## Example setup

- Delivery menu: 10 items, all under 15 minutes prep.
- Cap: 8 delivery orders per hour.
- Dispatch: one staff member during peak hours.
- Promotion: weekly post plus a dine-in invitation in every bag.

## Common mistakes

- Running the full menu on delivery.
- Accepting unlimited orders at peak.
- Letting delivery drivers crowd the bar.
- Ignoring margin impact.

## Quick checklist

- Delivery menu shortened and costed.
- Hourly order cap set.
- Dispatch station in place.
- Profit per channel reviewed weekly.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I offer discounts on delivery?**
Not unless you can protect margin through pricing or bundling. Discounts rarely build loyalty on platforms.

**How do I handle slow nights?**
Lift the cap slightly on quiet days, but keep the shorter menu and margin rules.
