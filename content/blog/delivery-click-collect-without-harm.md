# Harnessing Delivery and Click & Collect Without Killing Service

Delivery saved many pubs in lockdown but wrecked plenty of guest experiences once doors reopened. The answer is not to ditch the channel but to control it. Here is the system.

## Step 1: Separate Menus
Design a tight delivery menu with dishes that travel well and maintain healthy GP after fees. Remove items that need last-minute garnish or rely on crisp textures. Keep dine-in favourites exclusive so regulars still visit in person.

## Step 2: Ringfence Capacity
Use kitchen display systems or manual whiteboards to cap the number of delivery tickets per 15-minute block. Switch the platform off when the restaurant is slammed. A dispatcher (or the manager) owns the toggle.

## Step 3: Create a Dispatch Station
Set up a heated pass, dedicated packaging shelves, labels, and tamper seals near the back door. Train one team member per shift as dispatcher responsible for quality control, rider liaison, and guest communication.

## Step 4: Optimise Collection Flow
For click & collect, offer numbered bays or a separate hatch so regulars are in and out within two minutes. Use SMS updates to tell guests when their order is ready rather than letting them hover at the bar.

## Step 5: Track Profit Per Channel
Review platform fees, driver tips, and packaging costs monthly. If a channel underperforms, negotiate rates, introduce minimum order values, or pause it midweek.

## Step 6: Cross-Pollinate Marketing
Include flyers in every delivery bag promoting upcoming events, loyalty schemes, or dine-in exclusives. Offer delivery customers a code for priority booking on-site to convert them into regulars.

## Mini FAQ
**Do I need separate insurance?**
Most pub policies now include takeaway cover but confirm with your broker, especially for alcohol delivery.

**How do I handle rider delays?**
Build a 5-minute holding tolerance into cook times and communicate with the rider via the platform. If delays persist, escalate to the account manager and request rider quality audits.

Delivery should feel like a bonus revenue stream, not a burden. Control the inputs and the channel will support, not sabotage, the core business.
