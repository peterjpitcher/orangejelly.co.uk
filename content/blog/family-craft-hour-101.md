# Family Craft Hour 101: Safe Projects, Smooth Setups, Happy Families

If you want Sunday lunch bookings to grow, give parents something extra beyond roast potatoes. A structured craft hour keeps kids busy, reassures carers about safety, and fills quieter slots (10–11am, midday, or rainy half-term afternoons). Use this guide to plan projects, lay out the room, handle safeguarding and allergies, and promote the session.

## Who It’s For and When to Run It

- **Age range:** aim for 3–11 with a responsible adult per child. Offer a toddler-safe tray (chunky crayons, sticker sheets) so younger siblings aren’t left out.
- **Timing:** weekend mornings (10–11am) before the roast rush, or weekday afternoons during school holidays. Cap sessions at 60–75 minutes to minimise fatigue.
- **Booking model:** free with table reservation or £3–£5 per child including materials. Take pre-payments via your booking platform to reduce no-shows.

## Project Menu

| Theme | Activity | Mess level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Valentine’s/Mother’s Day | Card bar with stamps, dried petals, ribbon | Low | Pre-cut hearts, provide glue dots instead of wet glue. |
| Easter | Foam egg decorating, bunny-ear headbands | Medium | Avoid glitter—use metallic stickers instead. |
| Summer Holidays | DIY wind socks, beach-bottle sensory jars | Medium | Offer outdoor drying line. |
| Halloween | Paper lanterns, upcycled costume props | Medium-high | Tablecloths + aprons essential. |
| Christmas | Salt-dough ornaments (pre-baked), felt garlands | Medium | Air-dry overnight; provide boxes for transport. |

Prepare at least two stations per session: one seated craft, one “make and take” quick win. Include an upcycle corner (scrap fabric, cereal boxes) to keep costs down and spark creativity.

## Setup and Flow

1. **Arrival (5 mins):** sign-in desk collects guardian contact, allergies, photography preference. Issue wristbands or stickers (green = photo OK, red = no photos).
2. **Demo (5 mins):** facilitator shows finished sample and key steps.
3. **Make time (40 mins):** staff circulate with positive prompts; capture quotes for socials (with consent).
4. **Show-and-tell (5 mins):** quick parade or mini gallery.
5. **Tidy + transition (5 mins):** bins, wipes, labelled bags for take-home crafts.

> **Room map idea**  
> Entry/sign-in desk → consent icons → hand sanitiser  
> Station A (cut-and-stick) | Station B (colouring) | Station C (make & take)  
> Quiet table | Buggy park | First-aid point | Wash-up bin

## Materials and Sourcing

- **Consumables:** child-safe scissors, PVA glue sticks, masking tape, pipe cleaners, foam shapes, stickers, googly eyes, washi tape, non-toxic paint pens.
- **Surfaces:** wipe-clean cloths, kraft paper roll, clipboards for instructions.
- **Suppliers:** look for UKCA/CE marks and EN 71 references on craft kits/toys to ensure compliance with the UK Toys (Safety) Regulations. ([GOV.UK guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toys-safety-regulations-2011/toys-safety-regulations-2011-great-britain))
- **Allergy control:** avoid latex balloons, nut-based materials, fragranced glues. Display ingredient lists for any playdough or edible treats.

## Safeguarding and Photography

- Maintain ratios (1 staff per 8 children recommended). All staff should know who the designated safeguarding lead is.
- Keep a clearly signed “grown-ups must stay” policy—this isn’t a drop-off club.
- For photos/videos, follow NSPCC guidance: explain how images will be used, obtain consent, and store footage securely. ([NSPCC Learning](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/online-safety/photographing-filming-children))
- First aid: have at least one paediatric first-aider on shift, stock plasters/eyewash, and log any incidents immediately.

## Accessibility and Inclusion

- Offer adaptive scissors, chunky brushes, and stabilising mats for children with motor challenges.
- Provide visual step-by-step cards with icons and simple text.
- Keep a sensory-friendly corner with noise-reducing headphones, fidgets, and storybooks.
- Ensure tables are spaced for wheelchair access and prams.

## Budget and Bundles

| Item | Typical cost |
| --- | --- |
| Consumables per child | £1.50–£3.50 |
| Reusable kit (aprons, trays) | £30–£80 |
| Staff/facilitator hour | Standard FOH rate |
| Prize draw (optional) | £5–£20 (book voucher, dessert) |

Package craft hour with dining offers: “Craft & Roast” (£14.95 kids roast + craft station + dessert) or “Makers Mocktail” for parents.

## Marketing Playbook

- **Channels:** school/PTA newsletters, local Facebook “Family Fun” groups, WhatsApp parents chats, community noticeboards.
- **Messaging:** emphasise structured fun, all materials included, allergy-aware, booking essential.
- **Copy-ready caption:** “Family Craft Hour this Saturday, 10–11am. Ages 3–11 with a grown-up. Material kits included, book your table 👉 [link].”
- **Cross-links:** mention Family Craft Hour at the end of boardgame or quiz articles (“Looking for daytime fun? Try our craft hour.”)

## Risk Management and House Rules

- Display simple rules: walking feet, share tools, ask before using scissors, tidy your station.
- Keep spill kits, bin bags, and cloths nearby; brief staff on immediate clean-up to prevent slips.
- Store completed crafts away from hot surfaces and food areas.

## Metrics to Track

| KPI | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Families per session | 10 tables |
| Average spend | £55–£70 per table (craft + food) |
| Dessert add-on | 60% of families |
| Next-event pre-book | 50% before leaving |

Use a QR survey asking what themes families want next (Mother’s Day, World Book Day, etc.) and collect email opt-ins for future marketing.

## FAQs

**Do I need DBS checks for staff?** If the same team members regularly supervise children, DBS checks are strongly advised; at minimum have a named safeguarding lead and documented safer recruitment steps.  
**How do I manage allergies without scaring parents off?** Collect allergy info at sign-in, avoid high-risk materials (nuts, latex), label ingredients on homemade doughs, and keep EPI-pen-aware staff nearby.  
**How much buffer time should I allow for clean-up?** Build in a 15-minute reset after each session for wiping surfaces, restocking trays, and drying crafts before the lunch rush.  
**Can I monetise take-home kits?** Yes—bundle leftover supplies into £5 “mini kits” or offer pre-booked premium packs (e.g., wreath making) for seasonal upsell.  
**Do I need special insurance or risk assessments?** Review your public liability policy, complete an activity-specific risk assessment (tools, slips, choking hazards), and keep it on file with COSHH sheets for any paints/glues.
