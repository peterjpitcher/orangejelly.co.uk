# Brewery Tie Strangling Your Profits? Legal Ways to Improve Your Deal

Being tied can feel like running uphill with a weight vest. Higher keg prices and restricted buying power squeeze margin and create frustration. But you still have levers. The key is to work the tie, not just complain about it.

This guide is practical and experience-based, not legal advice. If you are unsure, speak to a qualified advisor.

## Start with the reality check

Before you negotiate, get clear on three facts:
- Your true gross profit across wet and dry.
- The exact products and categories where the tie hurts most.
- The support you are already entitled to but not using.

Most tied tenants improve margin simply by understanding their contract and using the help already available.

## Improve margin inside the tie

You are not powerless. These are the levers that usually work.

**1) Fix the drinks mix**
A tied beer list does not mean a low-margin bar. Build a ladder that includes premium spirits, wines, and soft drinks that are not tied, or are less impacted by the tie.

**2) Price with confidence**
If your tied core products are underpriced, you are subsidising demand. Reset pricing in small steps and use bundles to protect value perception.

**3) Push high margin add-ons**
Coffee, desserts, premium mixers, and low-AB serves often carry healthy margins. Train the team to recommend them consistently.

**4) Use supplier support**
Many tied agreements include marketing support, training, or equipment assistance. Ask directly for what you need rather than waiting to be offered.

## Work the BDM relationship

Your Business Development Manager is a lever. The best outcomes come from prepared conversations and evidence.

Bring:
- A simple P and L snapshot.
- A list of specific requests (discounts, marketing support, repairs, training).
- A clear plan of how you will grow revenue if supported.

This turns the conversation from complaint to partnership.

## Decide: stay tied or explore MRO

The Market Rent Only (MRO) route can be right for some operators and wrong for others. Treat it as a decision path, not a default.

**Stay tied if:**
- You rely on support and it is working.
- Your GP is improving with mix and pricing changes.
- You want stability and less admin overhead.

**Explore MRO if:**
- Your tie cost is materially higher than local free houses.
- You can access better supply deals independently.
- You have the operational capacity to manage suppliers.

If you are considering MRO, document the case and get proper advice before acting.

## A simple 90-day improvement plan

- Week 1 to 2: audit GP by category and reset pricing.
- Week 3 to 6: rebuild the drinks mix and train staff.
- Week 7 to 10: request supplier support and run one activation.
- Week 11 to 12: assess whether the tie is working for you.

## Common mistakes

- Assuming the tie is the only problem.
- Negotiating without data.
- Ignoring the mix and pricing you can control.
- Starting MRO without a clear plan.

## Quick checklist

- GP by category calculated.
- Pricing reviewed on top sellers.
- Supplier support requested.
- Decision path for MRO written down.

## Mini FAQ

**Can I renegotiate while tied?**
Yes, but you need a specific request and a business case.

**Is MRO always better?**
No. It depends on your purchasing power, costs, and ability to manage supply.
