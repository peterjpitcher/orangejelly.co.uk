# Partnering with Local Brands to Share Marketing Costs

Marketing budgets stretch further when you pool creativity and spend. The trick is picking partners that bring real reach, not just a logo on a poster. Follow this framework to collaborate without headaches.

## Step 1: Define Your Audience Gap
List the customer types you want more of (cyclists, remote workers, parents). Identify local brands already trusted by those people. Aim for complementary, not competing, offers.

## Step 2: Shortlist and Pitch
Approach 3-5 prospects with a clear ask:
- The concept (e.g. "Sunday Sourdough Sessions" with a bakery).
- What you provide (venue, drinks, staffing).
- What you need (email list share, product sampling, influencer reach).
- Proposed cost split.

Keep the pitch to one page.

## Step 3: Co-Create the Offer
Design something Instagrammable and genuinely useful, such as:
- Brunch club with yoga studio and coffee roaster.
- Local distillery takeover night.
- Makers market pop-up where each vendor brings their own crowd.

Agree on ticket price, capacity, and upsell opportunities.

## Step 4: Put Agreements in Writing
Even with friends, create a simple MOU covering dates, responsibilities, revenue split, insurance, and cancellation terms. It prevents awkwardness later.

## Step 5: Share Marketing Assets
Build a shared folder with copy, imagery, and tracking links. Schedule joint posts, newsletter swaps, and paid ads targeting both customer bases. Encourage partners to tag each other to amplify reach.

## Step 6: Measure and Debrief
After the activation, review KPIs: tickets sold, spend per head, new followers, email signups. Decide whether to repeat, scale, or pivot. Send thank-you gifts and testimonials so partners feel valued.

## Mini FAQ
**How do I avoid brand mismatch?**
Create a partner checklist: quality standards, sustainability values, customer service reputation. Stick to it even if someone offers cash but not credibility.

**Can I run multiple partnerships at once?**
Yes, but stagger them to avoid audience fatigue. Rotate segments monthly so each campaign feels special.

Shared marketing doubles reach while halving cost, provided you treat partners like co-founders, not sponsors.
