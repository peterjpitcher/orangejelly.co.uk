# Partnering with Local Brands to Share Marketing Costs

Good partnerships stretch your budget and make your pub feel more connected. The key is to choose partners with real audience overlap and to build a clear, shared offer.

Use this framework to collaborate without headaches.

## Step 1: Define the audience gap

Who do you want more of? Families, remote workers, young professionals, or foodies? Choose a partner that already has that audience.

## Step 2: Shortlist and pitch

Look for local businesses with active communities: gyms, bakers, florists, breweries, or clubs. Send a short, specific pitch.

Example pitch:
"We want to run a Friday local makers night. Your customers match our target. Would you like to co-host and split promotion?"

## Step 3: Co-create the offer

Build a simple offer both sides can promote.

Examples:
- A set menu plus a local dessert.
- A gym recovery brunch with a fixed price.
- A local brewery tap takeover with merch.

Keep the offer simple and time-bound.

## Step 4: Put agreements in writing

Even a one-page agreement avoids confusion. Include:
- Who pays for what.
- Revenue split.
- Who owns the guest list.
- Promotion responsibilities.

## Step 5: Share marketing assets

Create one shared asset pack: photo, caption, and a booking link. If you make it easy, partners will actually post.

## Step 6: Measure and debrief

Track bookings, spend per head, and new customers. Share results and decide whether to repeat.

## Common mistakes

- Partnering with businesses that do not share your audience.
- Letting the offer become too complicated.
- Failing to agree the split upfront.

## Quick checklist

- Target audience defined.
- Two partners shortlisted.
- One offer built and costed.
- One-page agreement signed.
- Results reviewed within a week of the event.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I split revenue or costs?**
Either can work. What matters is clarity before launch.

**How many partners should I run at once?**
Start with one. Build a repeatable format before scaling.
