# Low-Cost Decor Refreshes that Signal 'New and Improved'

Guests decide whether a venue feels tired within 30 seconds of walking through the door. Use these budget-friendly upgrades to prove you are levelling up.

## 1. Repaint Strategic Zones
Focus on the entrance, bar front, and feature wall behind seating. Choose three complementary colours: deep tone for drama, mid-tone for warmth, and light tone for ceilings. Use wipeable paint so maintenance stays simple.

## 2. Upgrade Signage and Menus
Replace faded A-boards with hand-painted plywood, swap plastic menu holders for clipboards, and add wayfinding arrows to toilets and gardens. Fresh typography signals professionalism.

## 3. Refresh Seating Without Replacing
Use stretch covers, new cushions, or reupholster just the seat pads. Mix fabrics (tweed, leatherette, cord) in a tight colour palette. Tighten wobbly legs and add felt pads to stop noise.

## 4. Layer Lighting
Combine pendant clusters, table lamps, and battery-powered candles. Install dimmers or smart bulbs so scenes change by daypart. Highlight shelf displays or artwork with inexpensive LED strips.

## 5. Bring the Outside In
Add hardy plants (snake plants, pothos) in mismatched pots plus dried flowers on tables. Partner with a local florist for monthly swaps in exchange for social tags.

## 6. Curate Talking Points
Create mini galleries of historical photos, framed bar mats, or local artist prints. Rotate quarterly to keep things fresh and give people reasons to share photos online.

## Mini FAQ
**How do I refresh without closing?**
Work overnight or during closed days, tackling one zone per week. Use dust sheets and clear signage so guests know improvements are underway.

**What about listed buildings?**
Focus on reversible changes: lighting, textiles, freestanding shelving. Always confirm with the council before altering fixtures.

Visual cues of improvement reassure guests that the business is thriving, not fading.
