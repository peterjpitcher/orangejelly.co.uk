# Profitable Pub Food Menu Ideas: High-Margin Dishes That Actually Sell

Food can save a pub or sink it. The goal is not just popular dishes, it is popular dishes that protect margin and keep the kitchen simple.

## Start with the profit basics

Know your true cost per dish. Include ingredients, prep time, and waste. A dish that looks profitable on paper can fail in practice if it is slow to deliver.

## Build a tighter menu

A smaller menu sells better and wastes less. Aim for:
- A few hero dishes.
- A couple of high-margin share plates.
- One or two rotating specials.

## High-margin categories that work

- Loaded fries and upgraded sides.
- Sharing boards.
- Comfort classics with low prep.
- Premium burgers with simple add-ons.
- Desserts with high perceived value.

Keep it simple and repeatable.

## Control costs without killing quality

- Cross-use ingredients across dishes.
- Standardise portion sizes.
- Buy smart with a weekly prep plan.

## A simple rollout plan

- Test two new dishes as specials.
- Track sales and margin for two weeks.
- Keep the winners, drop the rest.

## Common mistakes

- Too many dishes for the team to execute well.
- Pricing based on competitors instead of costs.
- Adding specials without a plan.

## Quick checklist

- Menu reduced and costed.
- Two hero dishes identified.
- Portion tools in place.
- Specials tested and reviewed.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I chase food trends?**
Only if they match your audience and kitchen capacity.

**How often should I change the menu?**
Seasonally, with small changes rather than full resets.
