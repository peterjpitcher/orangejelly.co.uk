# Cashflow Fixes: Immediate Steps When Trade Drops Off a Cliff

When takings fall 30% overnight, survival depends on speed and clarity. Here is the exact response plan I use with coaching clients so rent, payroll, and HMRC still get paid.

## 1. Build the Daily Cash War Room
Create a simple spreadsheet with columns for opening cash, expected income, committed outgoings, and closing cash for the next 13 weeks. Update it every morning. Colour-code red days where the pot goes negative and focus every action on removing that red.

## 2. Triage Costs by Impact
- **Must Pay**: wages, rent, HMRC, licensing.
- **Re-Negotiable**: drinks suppliers, food wholesalers, entertainment contracts.
- **Pause**: subscriptions, marketing retainers, linen upgrades, agency staff.
Call each supplier in order of spend, share the plan, and propose payment plans. Most will accept weekly transfers if you show discipline.

## 3. Convert Stock to Cash
- Highlight high-value spirits for feature pours and tasting flights.
- Bundle slow-moving wine into limited-price carafes.
- Promote cellar clear-outs via email and social to turn dormant inventory into bank balance.

## 4. Sell Future Value Today
Offer gift cards with 20% added value, Sunday roast pre-orders, or membership bundles that include quarterly events. Make sure the cash received is ring-fenced for the bills threatening you now.

## 5. Focus the Team on Contribution
Share the numbers with supervisors. Challenge them to find £200 extra GP per shift through upsells, tighter pours, and reducing comps. Reward success publicly with vouchers, time off, or bar tabs.

## 6. Protect Marketing That Works
Do not go dark – double down on the channels that reliably bring bookings (usually email and WhatsApp for locals). Shift paid ads to retargeting existing audiences instead of fishing cold.

## 7. Talk to the Landlord Early
Bring your cash plan, proof of marketing pushes, and projected recovery timelines. Ask for a short-term rent concession or switch to monthly payments. Silence breeds distrust; transparency earns breathing room.

## Mini FAQ
**Should I take a high-interest loan?**
Not until you have exhausted operational fixes. Expensive debt without a turnaround plan simply postpones the pain.

**What about staff hours?**
Trim from the edges – shorter shifts, multi-tasking, and voluntary unpaid leave before redundancies. Keep service standards intact or you will accelerate the revenue drop you are trying to cure.

Cash discipline buys you time; smart sales pushes bring the money back.
