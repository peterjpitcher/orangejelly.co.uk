# Cashflow Fixes: Immediate Steps When Trade Drops Off a Cliff

A sudden drop in takings does not mean the pub is broken. It means you need speed, clarity, and a plan that protects cash this week. The goal is to buy time without damaging the guest experience.

Here is the exact triage sequence we use when trade falls sharply.

## Step 1: Build the daily cash war room

Create a one-page cash board for the next 14 days. List every payment and every expected inflow. This is not a monthly forecast. It is a daily reality check.

Make it visible to the management team. Decisions should be made with the same numbers in front of everyone.

## Step 2: Triage costs by impact

Split costs into three buckets:
- **Must pay now**: wages, critical suppliers, tax deadlines.
- **Can delay with a plan**: non-essential suppliers, subscriptions, small contracts.
- **Can stop immediately**: unused tools, duplicate services, vanity spend.

This is where you create breathing room without gutting the offer.

## Step 3: Convert stock into cash

Identify stock that can be turned quickly into revenue.

- Run a focused special (not a blanket discount).
- Create a bundle using slow movers and a popular item.
- Promote it for seven days, then move on.

The rule: convert stock to cash without teaching customers to wait for discounts.

## Step 4: Sell future value today

Bring future cash forward with deposits and prepaid offers.

Options that work:
- Event deposits with a drink included.
- Gift cards with a modest bonus (for example, 30 pounds gets 35).
- A pre-paid Sunday roast slot with priority seating.

These create immediate cash without slashing margin.

## Step 5: Focus the team on contribution

Train the team to push the one or two items that actually move margin. Script it, practice it, and track it for a week.

A two percent shift in drink mix can stabilise a tight week.

## Step 6: Protect the marketing that works

The fastest mistake is turning off the only channel that drives bookings. If a specific post type or local group drives covers, keep it alive even when cash is tight.

Cut noise, not traction.

## Step 7: Talk to the landlord early

This is hard but important. Share the plan, not the panic. Explain the actions you are taking, and propose a clear, time-bound adjustment if needed.

The worst outcome is silence.

## Common mistakes

- Cutting marketing completely.
- Discounting the entire menu.
- Delaying supplier communication.
- Trying to fix everything in one week.

## Quick checklist

- 14-day cash board built.
- Costs triaged into three buckets.
- One cash-forward offer launched.
- Team briefed on two margin movers.
- Landlord or key suppliers updated.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I discount to drive traffic?**
Only if you can protect margins with bundles or upsells. Discounts alone create busy losses.

**How quickly should I act?**
Within 48 hours. Waiting for trade to bounce back is how shortfalls become crises.
