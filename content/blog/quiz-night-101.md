# Quiz Night 101: Plan, Host and Grow a Brilliant Weekly Quiz

Quiet Tuesdays don’t have to stay that way. A well-run pub quiz keeps regulars loyal, gives newcomers an easy first visit, and delivers a predictable midweek bump for the bar. This guide walks you through every element: format, staffing, question writing, marketing, accessibility, compliance, and the numbers you should track afterwards.

> **At-a-glance checklist**
> - ☐ Rounds scripted & printed  
> - ☐ Pens, answer sheets, float ready  
> - ☐ Playlist and audio clips tested  
> - ☐ Mic levels set  
> - ☐ Tie-break question prepared  
> - ☐ Prize list agreed  
> - ☐ Social posts scheduled  
> - ☐ Leaderboard updated

## What Makes a Quiz Night Work

Successful quiz nights share six traits:

1. **Clear format.** Five to six rounds, 8–10 questions each, 90–120 minutes total. Everyone knows when the breaks are and how scoring works.
2. **Consistency.** Same day, time, and host tone each week so guests build the quiz into their routine.
3. **Pacing.** Rounds last 12–15 minutes with five-minute breaks for the bar; background tunes return between rounds to keep atmosphere up.
4. **Fairness.** Difficulty spreads from easy warm-up to tough tie-break, with a mix of subjects so no team feels excluded.
5. **Atmosphere.** Lighting lowered but readable, music at conversational level pre/post rounds, mic levels matched to room size.
6. **Community.** Team names read aloud, birthdays acknowledged, leaderboards posted online or on the chalkboard next day.

## Choose Your Format

Most pubs rotate between a classic mixed quiz, themed nights, and interactive rounds to keep things fresh without rewriting the rulebook.

### Core structures

| Round | Focus | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Warm-Up | General knowledge | 10 questions to build confidence. |
| Music | 10–20s audio clips | Name artist/title; note the year for bonus. |
| Pictures | Logos, landmarks, famous faces | Print A4 sheets or display on TVs. |
| Specialist | Science, literature, sport | Rotate weekly; announce ahead of time. |
| Connections | Five clues + final link | Nod to "Only Connect" fans. |
| Speed Round | 60-second quick-fire | Each team answers privately; perfect near the end. |
| Tie-break | Nearest number | E.g., exact population of Staines-upon-Thames. |

**Theme nights** (90s club classics, Christmas cracker, local history, TV & Film) bring in new audiences, but keep a classic mix every other week so regulars aren’t alienated.

### Interactive ideas

- Pictionary or charades on a flip chart.
- Mystery box item passed around under cloth.
- “Closest-to” cards for estimated answers—collect at end for fun stats.
- Playlist battle where two teams submit playlists and the room votes during breaks.

## Scoring and Fair Play

- **Marking:** swap answer sheets with neighbouring tables and mark as you announce answers. The host collects and logs scores to avoid disputes.
- **Bonus points:** award one bonus for best team name or for teams who share a photo and tag the venue.
- **Anti-cheat measures:** remind teams about phones away, position staff to notice suspicious play, and keep prizes fun rather than overly valuable.
- **Leaderboard:** maintain a Google Sheet or chalkboard with cumulative points. Offer a monthly playoff for bragging rights instead of giant prizes.

## Roles and Run-of-Show

Even if you’re a one-person band, list the hats you’re wearing. Ideally:

- **Host/Quizmaster:** writes or curates rounds, controls pacing, handles patter.
- **Scorekeeper/Runner:** collects sheets, totals scores, keeps leaderboard tidy.
- **Sound tech:** sets mic/speaker balance, triggers music/audio rounds.
- **Front-of-house:** pushes bundles during breaks, reserves tables, handles entry fees.

**Sample timeline (doors 19:00, quiz 19:30–21:20):**

| Time | Segment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 19:30 | Welcome & rules | Plug bundles, remind no phones. |
| 19:40 | Round 1 – Warm-Up | 10 Qs. |
| 19:55 | Scoring break | Swap sheets, collect, announce top 3. |
| 20:00 | Round 2 – Music | Play clips via laptop/phone; cue volume lower than voice. |
| 20:15 | Break | Push bar snacks, capture stories. |
| 20:20 | Round 3 – Pictures | Display via TV/projector or printed sheets. |
| 20:35 | Round 4 – Specialist | Announce next week’s theme mid-round. |
| 20:50 | Round 5 – Connections + Speed | Combination keeps energy up. |
| 21:10 | Tie-break + winners | Present prizes, take photos, trail next quiz. |

## Kit and Setup

| Item | Why you need it | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PA/speaker + mic | Ensure every table hears clearly | Test before doors open; keep mic gain low. |
| Laptop/tablet | Run music/picture rounds | Download files offline in case Wi-Fi fails. |
| HDMI cable / Chromecast | Display picture rounds | Label cables and test with house TVs. |
| Printed answer sheets | Faster marking | Include team name, contact email, tie-break line. |
| Pens/pencils | No fumbling | Keep extras behind bar. |
| Float | Entry fees/charity donations | Note start/end totals for reconciliation. |

**Budget guide:** £0–£150 for prizes (bar tabs, merch), £20–£60 printing, £50–£200 if hiring an external host.

## Questions People Love (with examples)

- **Local flavour:** “What river separates Staines from Egham?” (Answer: River Thames.)
- **Soundbites:** play the first second of “Common People”—ask for artist + album year.
- **Picture clue:** zoomed-in shot of a Greene King pump clip.
- **Connections:** Q1 “Haddock”, Q2 “Puffin”, Q3 “Gannet”, Q4 “Fulmar”, Q5 “Tern” → Connection: all birds on UK postage stamps.
- **Closest-to tie-break:** “How many casks does the average Greene King managed pub sell per week?”

Aim for a 60/30/10 mix (easy/medium/tricky). Keep a spreadsheet tagging each question by topic so you don’t repeat within eight weeks.

## Prizes That Drive Return Visits

- £20–£30 bar tab.
- Local collaborator voucher (butcher, florist, barber)—low cost, cross-promo.
- Rolling jackpot jar (capped under £50 to avoid gambling implications).
- Booby prize: pickled egg, bag of crisps, or pub-branded wooden spoon for last place.

## Marketing Plan (four-week cadence)

| Timeline | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| Week –4/–3 | Create Facebook event, update Google Business Profile, design posters/chalkboard. |
| Week –2 | Share reel of last week’s laughter; drop teaser question. |
| Week –1 | DM loyal teams with booking link; push email to newsletter. |
| Day –1 | Stories countdown, playlist sneak peek, remind of bundle offer. |
| Day 0 | Go Live post at noon + Stories from setup. |
| Day +1 | Publish winners photo (with consent), plug next date. |

**Copy-ready post:** “Quiz Night is back Tuesday, 7.30pm. £2pp, max 6 per team, prizes + bragging rights. Book now 👉 [link].”

## Accessibility and Inclusion

- Offer large-print answer sheets (14pt+ font) on request.
- Repeat each question twice and display picture/keyword slides where possible.
- Keep aisles clear for sheet collection; provide chairs without high stools for mobility needs.
- Avoid culturally specific jokes or references unless you explain them.

## Compliance Corner: Music Licensing

If you play recorded music (audio clips, walk-in playlists) or host live performance, you’ll usually need **TheMusicLicence** from PPL PRS, which covers both PRS for Music and PPL permissions. Confirm your venue’s licence and keep documentation handy. More information: [PPL PRS](https://pplprs.co.uk/themusiclicence/).

## Metrics and Post-Event Debrief

Track these four numbers weekly:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headcount / teams | +10–15 covers vs baseline | Log new vs repeat teams. |
| Average spend per head | £18–£22 | Compare bundle vs à-la-carte. |
| Dwell time | 90+ minutes | Longer suggests bundles working. |
| Next-week pre-book | 50% of teams committed | Use QR or quick show of hands. |

Debrief with staff within 12 hours: Which rounds landed? Any tech wobbles? Did we capture content? Who’s on hosting duty next week?

## FAQs

**How much prep time should I budget each week?** Once the format is locked, plan 60–90 minutes to refresh question banks, schedule socials, and print sheets; batch four weeks at a time to cut that in half.  
**Do I need extra licensing for the music round?** Yes—recorded clips normally require **TheMusicLicence** (PPL PRS). Confirm your venue’s coverage before advertising audio rounds.  
**Is it better to charge entry or bundle?** Bundles (£10 entry + drink + snack) drive higher spend and make reporting easier; switch to a suggested donation only if your demographic resists paying.  
**What if attendance is slow for the first month?** Keep the slot going for at least four weeks, share photos even if turnout is small, and personally invite known regulars; consistency builds momentum.  
**What metrics should I share with my BDM or owner?** Track headcount, average spend, dwell time, and next-week bookings so you can evidence uplift versus a normal Tuesday.
