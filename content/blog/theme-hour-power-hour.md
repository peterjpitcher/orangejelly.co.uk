faqs:
  - question: "Do I need extra security for Theme Hour?"
    answer: "Not usually, but brief any SIA team on the exact schedule so they are ready for sing-along surges or prize celebrations and can step in if a crowd gets too lively."
  - question: "How loud should the activation run?"
    answer: "Keep volume below the point where conversations struggle. Theme Hour is about energy, not a rave, so run wireless mics with compression and lean on crowd participation rather than deafening music."
  - question: "What if guests show up halfway through?"
    answer: "Introduce a wildcard pass at the midpoint so late arrivals can jump into a challenge instantly without needing earlier context."
  - question: "Can I host Theme Hour outdoors?"
    answer: "Yes, just use battery-powered speakers, waterproof wheel covers, and a rain move-in plan with folding tables or a canopy so you can relocate in under five minutes."

# Theme Hour Saturdays: Power Hour & Spin-to-Win Toolkit

Saturday pre-peak (4–6pm) is prime for a punchy activation that fills the bar without cannibalising dining tables. Theme Hour keeps it tight: 60 minutes of nostalgia hits, predictable scripts, and repeatable prize mechanics.

## Why Theme Hour Works
- **Short and sharp:** Guests commit to one hour, then stay for dinner or rebook for next week.
- **Low lift:** Reuse existing playlists, handheld mics, and prize stock.
- **Margin friendly:** £12–£14 Power-Hour Spritz bundle delivers healthy GP and anchors the promo.
- **Content factory:** Every spin, winner, and crowd sing-along becomes a reel for the following week.

## Choose Your Theme

| Theme | Structure | Staff Needed | Prize Ideas |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **80s/90s Power Hour** | 6× ten-minute mini sets (sing-alongs, trivia shout-outs, air-guitar comp) | MC + floor runner + DJ/tablet operator | Retro merch, dinner vouchers, branded tapes |
| **Spin-to-Win Wheel** | Wheel with 8 wedges (spritz upgrade, merch, surprise task) triggered every 10 mins | MC + host to verify spins | Sponsor tabs, dessert shots, queue skips |
| **Playlist Battle** | Two playlists compete; crowd applause meter decides the winner | MC + volunteer counters | Round of drinks for the team on stage |
| **Flash Challenge Hour** | Dance-off, lyric-finish, “guess the riff” back-to-back | MC only if using autop-run cues | Gift cards, dessert tokens, VIP booth |

Pick one theme per month to build muscle memory for staff and regulars.

## Run-of-Show (Example for Power Hour)
| Time | Beat | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-30 | Staff brief, test mic + speaker, pre-batch spritz pitchers | Scripted cards printed |
| 00:00 | MC welcome, plug bundle + dinner bookings | Spotlight next Theme Hour date |
| 00:05 | Mini challenge #1 (finish the lyric) | Winner gets spritz upgrade |
| 00:15 | Competition #2 (dance cam) | Capture video for socials |
| 00:25 | Spin-the-wheel break | Offer private booth upsell |
| 00:35 | Flash trivia blitz (5 questions) | Use QR to capture emails |
| 00:45 | Final showdown (choir sing-off) | Promote after-party playlist |
| 00:55 | Winners parade + next-week teaser | Push booking QR again |

Keep the MC script in 5-minute increments so covering staff can run it if the lead calls in sick.

## Prize & Bundle Mechanics
- **Power-Hour Spritz:** £12 per serve (Prosecco/AF option, garnish skewer, branded stirrer). Offer buy-3-get-4th for tables.
- **Wheel wedges:** 2× “Spritz on us,” 2× “Spin again,” 1× “Merch drop,” 1× “Pick the next song,” 1× “Chef’s snack,” 1× “Neighbour shout-out.”
- **Stamps:** Attend four Theme Hours, unlock a “booth takeover” for the group.
- **Local collabs:** Print instant photo souvenirs (£1 cost, £5 upsell) with sponsor logo.

## Promotion Timetable
- **Monday:** Drop teaser reel with last week’s winners + CTA.
- **Wednesday:** Send SMS/WhatsApp reminder to booking list (“Spin-to-Win seats released for Saturday 4pm”).
- **Friday:** Print table toppers for lunch service pushing the hour.
- **Saturday morning:** Post schedule graphic + prize highlight. Encourage DMs for booth reservations.

## Ops & Safeguarding
- Keep walkway clear around the wheel or dance floor; mark out zones with tape.
- Sound limiter in place if you’re in residential zones; have a “crowd cheer” meter that works at low volume.
- Pre-assign a staff member to capture consent for photos (wristbands for opt-outs).
- If drinks promos are in effect, stick to “bundled value” (spritz + snack) rather than straight discounts to stay within licensing guidance.
- Debrief at 6pm sharp before dinner shift: what hit, what to tweak, prize stock left.

## Measuring Success
| KPI | Goal | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bar revenue 4–6pm | Lift vs baseline | Compare POS by week |
| Bundle attachment | Strong | Dedicated PLU |
| Dinner rollover bookings | Steady per hour | QR/res list |
| Content captured | A handful per event | Shot list tracking |

## Copy Snippets
- **Caption:** “Theme Hour • Saturdays 4–5pm • 80s vs 90s + spin wheel prizes + Power-Hour Spritz. Limited booths — DM to grab yours.”
- **MC line:** “Spin wins only land if you’re holding a spritz — grab one at the bar before the next cue.”
- **Staff script:** “We wrap at 5 so you can slide into dinner — want me to check the bookings list for you now?”

## FAQs
**Do I need extra security?** Not usually, but brief your SIA team (if you have one) on the schedule so they’re ready for sing-along surges or prize excitement.

**How loud should it be?** Keep below conversation-crushing levels. Theme Hour is about energy, not raves. Use wireless mics with compressors to avoid peaks.

**What if guests arrive late?** Run a “wildcard pass” at the halfway mark so newcomers can jump straight into a challenge without knowing earlier rules.

**Can I run it outdoors?** Yes, but use battery-powered speakers, waterproof wheel coverings, and always have a rain move-in plan (folding tables, canopy, towels).

Make Theme Hour the Saturday ritual that ushers day-drinkers into dinner spend and gives staff something fun (and scripted) to look forward to every week.
