# Community Outreach Ideas That Reintroduce Your Pub to the Neighbourhood

When locals forget you exist, no amount of Instagram ads will fix it. You need to show up in the places they care about. Here are outreach ideas that create genuine goodwill and, yes, new trade.

## 1. Adopt a Local Cause
Pick one school, hospice, or youth club and commit for 12 months. Provide meeting space, donate a portion of quiz takings, and let them take over your socials once a month to share updates.

## 2. Run Useful Workshops
Offer free or pay-what-you-can sessions: CV clinics for school leavers, "how to start a side hustle" chats, or cooking demos for parents. Partner with local experts to deliver value while showcasing your hospitality.

## 3. Host Neighbourhood Forums
Quarterly open evenings where residents can meet councillors, police liaison officers, or business groups. Provide tea, biscuits, and a structured agenda. Being the venue for civic conversation builds trust fast.

## 4. Offer Mini Grants
Set aside £500 per quarter for micro-grants (£50-£150) to community projects. Ask applicants to pitch in person at a "Community Dragons" night hosted at the pub. The audience votes, the energy is electric, and projects shout you out for months.

## 5. Support Local Creators
Rotate wall space for artists, hold book launches for local authors, or host vinyl swaps. Take only a small commission and encourage creators to invite their followers.

## 6. Celebrate Volunteers
Throw an annual party for the town's volunteers. Provide drinks deals, certificates, and public thank-yous. Invite the local paper – they love this stuff.

## Mini FAQ
**Is outreach just charity?**
No. It is strategic relationship-building. Track enquiries, bookings, and press mentions tied to each initiative to prove ROI.

**How do I staff these extras?**
Leverage quieter dayparts, recruit volunteers, and collaborate with partners who can bring their own marshals. You provide the stage; they bring the act.

Community work done right fills the diary because people book venues they emotionally invest in.
