# Zero-Waste Stock Management for Pubs in Survival Mode

Every kilo wasted is lost runway. When the overdraft is maxed, you cannot afford lazy prep, mystery kegs, or bins stuffed with half-prepped veg. Follow this zero-waste framework to keep cash in the till and morale high.

## 1. Count More Often, Not Just Deeper
Swap monthly mega counts for twice-weekly micro counts on the top 40 lines. Use shelf sheets or software like BevSpot, but the key is accountability: the same person counts a category every time so variances are easier to trace.

## 2. Engineer Menus Around Shared Ingredients
Limit SKUs by designing dishes that use the same base prep three ways. Example: roasted cauliflower becomes a vegan main, bar snack topping, and Sunday roast side. Track contributions, not just romance around new dishes.

## 3. Portion Control Is Culture
Equip the kitchen with pre-labelled deli tubs, digital scales, and ladles that match the spec. On the bar, mandate jiggers and automatic wine pourers. Celebrate the team when wastage logs hit targets; coach immediately when they do not.

## 4. FIFO Isn’t Optional
Date-label everything, build a colour system (red = use today), and store high-risk items at eye level. Run daily fridge clear-downs where the chef on duty lists what must sell that shift. Bar managers should do the same with partial kegs and open wine.

## 5. Turn Waste Into Revenue
- Soup or curry of the day built from trim.
- Brewery board that sells the last pint of each keg at a premium because it funds the staff beer kitty.
- Cocktail riffs that highlight surplus fruit or syrups.

## 6. Share Waste KPIs Publicly
Pin a whiteboard in the kitchen and cellar showing waste versus target (aim for as low as possible). Update after every count. When the number creeps up, investigate immediately rather than shrugging at month end.

## 7. Invest in Training Before Tech
Fancy sensors are useless if the team does not care. Spend time explaining the why: waste equals missed pay rises, tired equipment, and fewer marketing pounds. Ownership follows understanding.

## Mini FAQ
**Do I need software?**
Not to start. Google Sheets plus disciplined people beat expensive platforms poorly used. Upgrade only when the basics are second nature.

**How do I handle staff meals without skewing data?**
Log them. Allocate a daily allowance, ring them through at £0, and track the cost in your P&L under staff welfare so GP stays honest.

Scrappy counting and proud culture can cut wastage fast, freeing cash for the comeback.
