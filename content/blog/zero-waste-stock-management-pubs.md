# Zero-Waste Stock Management for Pubs in Survival Mode

Every kilo wasted is lost runway. When cash is tight, stock control becomes a survival skill. The goal is not perfection, it is a disciplined rhythm that stops money going in the bin.

## Step 1: Count more often, not deeper

Weekly counts beat monthly deep dives. Short, regular checks surface problems early and keep the team accountable.

## Step 2: Engineer menus around shared ingredients

Build a menu where one ingredient appears in at least three dishes. Cross-use reduces waste and makes prep easier.

## Step 3: Portion control is culture

If portions vary, margins vanish. Use scoops, scales, and standard builds so every plate costs the same.

## Step 4: FIFO is not optional

First in, first out should be visible and enforced. Label everything with dates and train the team to follow it.

## Step 5: Turn waste into revenue

Create a weekly "rescue" special from surplus stock. If done consistently, guests see it as creativity, not desperation.

## Step 6: Share waste KPIs publicly

Track waste weight or value each week and share it with the team. Visibility creates care.

## Step 7: Train before you buy tech

Systems fail when people do not follow them. Fix habits first, then add tools if needed.

## Common mistakes

- Counting only when money is already tight.
- Over-ordering to avoid stockouts.
- Ignoring waste logs after the first week.

## Quick checklist

- Weekly count scheduled.
- Cross-use ingredients identified.
- Portion tools in place.
- Waste log visible.

## Mini FAQ

**Does zero waste mean no waste?**
No. It means disciplined reduction. The goal is consistent improvement, not perfection.

**What is the fastest win?**
