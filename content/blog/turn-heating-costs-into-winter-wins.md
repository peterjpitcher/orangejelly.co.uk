The thermostat's clicking on again. That familiar hum of the heating system firing up sends a small shiver down your spine - not from the cold, but from knowing what's coming on next month's energy bill.

I get it. When I see that November energy statement showing heating costs jumping from summer levels to winter peak, that increase feels massive. But here's what I've learned: that heating bill isn't a cost to fear - it's an investment in creating the perfect environment for generating winter revenue.

Let me share something that changed my entire perspective on heating costs. Last February, during the coldest week of the year, our heating bill hit a painful peak. But spread across the covers for the month, it's a small cost per customer to keep them warm and comfortable. When you realise that selling just one extra hot drink per table can cover that cost, the investment suddenly makes sense.

## The Real Problem

The hospitality sector spends huge sums on energy bills, with a large chunk going on heating and cooling. Energy prices have stabilised somewhat from their peak, but commercial rates remain well above pre-2020 levels. 

But focusing on the cost is missing the bigger picture. The real problem isn't the £700 monthly increase - it's not leveraging the warm environment you're paying for to drive revenue. Every degree of warmth you pump into your pub is an opportunity to sell comfort, community, and escape from the cold.

Most publicans see heating as a grudge purchase. They turn thermostats down, close off sections, reduce hours. Meanwhile, their customers are desperate for somewhere warm and welcoming to spend their evenings. You're literally paying to create what people want most in winter - so why not monetise it properly?

## Turn Temperature Into Theatre

### Create Winter Comfort Zones
Transform your pub into distinct comfort experiences that people will pay premium for:

**The Fireside Premium Area**
- Reserve tables nearest heat sources for bookings only
- Charge a small deposit (redeemable against spend)
- Include complimentary blanket and first hot drink
- Watch these tables book out every Friday and Saturday

When we tested this concept, our "warm zone" tables near the fireplace consistently spent more per head than standard seating. The uplift on your best tables adds up fast.

**Action Steps:**
- Map your warmest spots this week
- Create "comfort packages" for these areas
- Start taking bookings with deposits
- Track revenue per table to prove the concept

## Hot Drinks That Actually Sell

### Beyond Basic Coffee
Forget competing with Costa on lattes. Create signature hot drinks that tell a story and command premium prices:

**Price Points That Work:**
- **House Hot Chocolate** (£4.50): Real chocolate, whipped cream
- **Spiked Hot Chocolate** (£6.50): Add Baileys or rum
- **Irish Coffee** (£7): Whiskey, coffee, cream float
- **Mulled Wine** (£5): House recipe with spices

If you're selling a handful of hot drinks daily, aim to double it by actively promoting them. The additional profit can cover a winter heating increase.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- Source quality hot chocolate (not powder)
- Buy vintage teapots from charity shops
- Train staff on theatrical presentation
- Create Instagram-worthy garnishes
- Price at a healthy multiple of cost

## Transform Dead Time Into Profit

### Afternoon Coffee Clubs
Your heating's on from 11am but quiet until evening? Here's an opportunity for 2026:

**Monday-Thursday "Warm & Toasty" Club (2pm-5pm):**
- Low entry fee includes hot drink and biscuits
- Newspapers, board games, free WiFi
- Quiet background music
- Bring your laptop, bring your knitting, bring your friend

Even starting with a handful of people daily can generate meaningful revenue from dead hours. Build it into a steady habit using heating you're already paying for.

**Action Plan:**
- Choose your quietest weekday periods
- Create a simple, appealing offer
- Target local Facebook groups
- Start next Monday - don't overthink it

## Weekend Winter Experiences

### Addressing the Weekend Challenge
With weekend footfall dropping, here are targeted solutions for 2026:

**1. Saturday Brunch Club (11am-2pm)**
- Full English + hot drink: £12.95
- Add Bloody Mary for £5
- Target: 20-25 covers = £260-325
- Uses morning heating already on

**2. Sunday Roast Enhancement**
- Traditional roast: £14.95
- "Winter Warmer Deal": Roast + dessert + hot drink: £19.95
- Focus on quality and comfort
- Push from 60 to 80 covers = extra £300 revenue

**3. Winter Wednesday Specials**
- Comfort food menu: pies, stews, hot puddings
- Price point: £10-12
- Include hot drink for £2 extra
- Target: 30-40 covers midweek

**Realistic Monthly Addition: Meaningful uplift**
**Extra heating cost: Minimal (already on)**
**Net Gain: Meaningful uplift**

## The Psychology of Warmth

### Price Perception Changes With Temperature
When people are cold, they value warmth exponentially more. Here's what we've observed:

**Cold Days (very cold):**
- Hot drink orders jump
- Customers stay longer
- Food attachment rate increases
- Premium options sell better

**Mild Days (above 10°C):**
- Hot drinks drop back to normal
- Quick pint and go behaviour
- Price sensitivity returns
- Less willing to try new items

The colder it gets, the more valuable your warm space becomes. Position yourself as the warm refuge, not just another pub.

## Your Action Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
**Monday:** Audit your heating zones - identify the warmest spots
**Tuesday:** Create three signature hot drinks with healthy margins
**Wednesday:** Set up "Warm & Toasty" afternoon sessions
**Thursday:** Design comfort packages for premium seating
**Friday:** Brief your team on upselling hot drinks

### Week 2: Momentum
**Monday:** Launch social media campaign: "The Warmest Welcome in Town"
**Tuesday:** Partner with local businesses for "warm refuge" vouchers
**Wednesday:** Introduce breakfast service on quietest morning
**Thursday:** Create "heating bill offset" tracking sheet

### Week 3: Acceleration

## Common Objections Solved

**"My customers won't pay premium for hot drinks..."**
Start with mid-range pricing at £4.50-5.50. Focus on quality and presentation. Once established, introduce one or two premium options at £6.50-7 for those who want to treat themselves. You'll be surprised who upgrades.

**"I don't have time to run afternoon sessions..."**
You don't need to be there. One staff member can manage 15-20 afternoon customers easily. They're low-maintenance - they want warmth, WiFi, and refills.

**"What if it's a mild winter..."**
British winters always have cold snaps. Plus, you're building habits that extend beyond temperature - community, comfort, and quality time.

## The Unexpected Benefits

Since implementing our "warm refuge" strategy, we've discovered bonuses we never expected:

**Community Impact:**

- Remote workers use us as their winter office
- Parents meet here while kids are at school
- We've become essential infrastructure

## The Bottom Line

Your winter heating increase isn't a burden - it's a revenue opportunity waiting to happen. Sell more hot drinks and you've covered your heating. Everything else is profit.

Stop seeing yourself as a pub owner with a heating problem. Start seeing yourself as a comfort provider in a cold world. Your warm pub is exactly what people need when it's miserable outside.

Next time that heating clicks on, don't wince at the cost. Think about the opportunity. You're creating the perfect environment for people to spend a little extra they wouldn't spend at home.

Your first step? Tomorrow, create three winter hot drinks. Price them properly (£4.50-6.50). Train your team to suggest them. Watch what happens when it's cold outside.

*Remember: A heating increase can generate extra revenue, but only if you act on it.*
