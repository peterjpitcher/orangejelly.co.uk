# Start Planning Christmas Now: 30 Festive Ideas to Secure December Bookings Early

Christmas makes or breaks the year for many pubs. The winners start planning early, lock in corporate bookings, and create a clear festive offer that is easy to say yes to. This guide trims the noise and focuses on the ideas that actually drive bookings.

## The three things that matter most

1) **Packages that sell**: clear pricing, limited options, easy upsells.
2) **Advance bookings**: deposits and early bird incentives.
3) **A visible calendar**: guests want to see what is happening before they commit.

## Package ideas that actually book out

- Fixed menu plus welcome drink.
- Sharing boards plus party playlists for smaller groups.
- Lunchtime corporate packages with a hard finish time.

Keep the packages simple and margin positive. Too many options slows decisions.

## Event ideas that create buzz

Choose two or three and build them into the calendar.

- Christmas quiz with a booking cap.
- Local choir or school performance night.
- "Thank you" night for local businesses.

## Daytime wins (often overlooked)

- Festive lunch for retirees and local groups.
- Afternoon kids crafts tied to a roast booking.
- Coffee and mince pie morning for remote workers.

Daytime events fill gaps and add incremental revenue.

## Promotions that protect margin

- Upgrade bundles (starter or dessert add-on).
- Premium drinks packages.
- Early booking bonus rather than discounts.

## A simple planning timeline

**July to August**: draft packages and pricing.
**September**: launch bookings and deposits.
**October**: push corporate bookings.
**November**: final push and confirmation.
**December**: execute and capture reviews.

## Common mistakes

- Launching too late.
- Overcomplicated menus.
- Taking large bookings without deposits.

## Quick checklist

- Two core packages priced and ready.
- Booking cap set for each event.
- Deposit policy live.
- Calendar published online and in the pub.

## Mini FAQ

**How early should I open bookings?**
September is the latest. Many corporate groups book in August.

**Should I discount to win parties?**
No. Use added value instead of price cuts.
