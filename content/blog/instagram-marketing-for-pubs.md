# Instagram Marketing for Pubs: Turn Food Photos Into Foot Traffic

Instagram is not just about pretty photos. It is about showing the experience and making it easy for people to choose you. The winning formula is consistent visuals, clear offers, and a simple booking path.

## Step 1: Set a visual standard

Use natural light, clean backgrounds, and consistent framing. A simple phone setup is enough if it is consistent.

## Step 2: Build three content pillars

- **Food and drink**: your strongest sellers.
- **People and atmosphere**: the room and the crowd.
- **Events and offers**: the reason to visit.

Rotate these each week.

## Step 3: Post with a clear CTA

Every post should answer: what should the viewer do next?

Examples:
- "Book for Thursday now."
- "Walk-ins welcome after 7."
- "DM to reserve a table."

## Step 4: Use stories for urgency

Stories are perfect for availability updates, behind-the-scenes clips, and quick reminders. Use them daily during event weeks.

## Step 5: Engage locally

Comment on local posts, tag partners, and use local hashtags. Instagram rewards local relevance.

## Common mistakes

- Posting without a clear offer.
- Using dark or blurry photos.
- Ignoring comments and DMs.

## Quick checklist

- Three content pillars planned.
- Weekly posting rhythm set.
- CTA added to every post.
- Stories used for urgency.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need a professional camera?**
No. A phone and consistent light are enough.

**How often should I post?**
Three to four posts a week plus stories during event weeks.
