# Facebook Marketing for Local Pubs: Your Community Connection Goldmine

Facebook is still where local communities plan their week. Done properly, it can fill tables without expensive ads. The key is to treat it as a community channel, not just a noticeboard.

## Step 1: Fix the basics on your page

- Correct opening hours.
- A clear booking link.
- Current photos of food and the room.

Outdated pages kill trust fast.

## Step 2: Use events properly

Create Facebook events for quizzes, tastings, and live music. Invite regulars and ask staff to share. Events create reminders and reach beyond your followers.

## Step 3: Be present in local groups

Local groups drive real footfall. Do not spam. Post useful updates and respond to comments. The goal is to be helpful, not salesy.

## Step 4: Run small, targeted ads

A small budget can go a long way when targeting a 5 to 10 mile radius. Promote one clear offer with a booking link.

## Step 5: Use Messenger for bookings

Make it easy for people to ask questions and book. Quick replies build trust and convert faster.

## Weekly rhythm

- Monday: what is on.
- Wednesday: event reminder.
- Friday: social proof or live update.

## Common mistakes

- Posting without a CTA.
- Ignoring comments.
- Using stock photos instead of real ones.

## Quick checklist

- Page updated.
- Events created for key nights.
- Group posts scheduled.
- Messenger replies set up.

## Mini FAQ

**Is Facebook still worth it?**
For local pubs, yes. It often outperforms other platforms for bookings.

**How often should I post?**
Two to three times a week is enough if it is consistent.
