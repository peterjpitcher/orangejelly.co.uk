# Menu Engineering Tricks to Lift Average Spend Fast

The difference between a 19 pound spend and a 24 pound spend is rarely the kitchen. It is layout, choice architecture, and the way the team presents options. Menu engineering is about guiding guests to the items that make you money without making them feel sold to.

## Step 1: Categorise the menu by profit and popularity

Use a simple matrix:
- **Stars**: high profit, high popularity.
- **Plowhorses**: low profit, high popularity.
- **Puzzles**: high profit, low popularity.
- **Dogs**: low profit, low popularity.

The goal is to push stars, fix puzzles, and remove dogs.

## Step 2: Put your stars where eyes land

Guests read menus in predictable patterns. Place star items at the top right, or at the start of sections. Avoid burying your best margin items in the middle.

## Step 3: Use decoys and anchors

A slightly higher priced item can make the next one feel better value. Use this to steer choices upward without discounting.

Example:
- Burger at 15.95 (anchor)
- Burger at 13.95 (target)

## Step 4: Build add-on lines

Add simple upsells under key dishes: "Add a side for 3" or "Upgrade to a premium pour." It is low effort and high return.

## Step 5: Pair food and drink on the menu

If a dish pairs with a specific drink, name it. Guests are far more likely to add a drink if the suggestion is visible.

## Step 6: Train the team on three scripts

- "Most people add the rosemary fries with that."
- "That dish pairs perfectly with the house red."
- "If you are hungry, the sharing board is great to start."

Scripted lines remove hesitation and lift spend.

## Step 7: Run a two-week test

Change only one thing, then track the result. If average spend lifts, keep the change. If not, revert and test another.

## Common mistakes

- Editing the menu monthly without measuring.
- Leaving low-margin items in prime positions.
- Adding too many options.

## Quick checklist

- Menu items mapped to the star matrix.
- Stars placed in visual hotspots.
- Add-ons listed under key dishes.
- Team trained on three scripts.
- Two-week test scheduled.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need a designer?**
Not always. Small layout changes and consistent spacing can do most of the work.

**How fast can average spend lift?**
Often within two weeks if the menu layout and scripts are applied consistently.
