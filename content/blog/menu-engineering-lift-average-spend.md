# Menu Engineering Tricks to Lift Average Spend Fast

The difference between a £19 and £24 average spend sits in typography, psychology, and scripting. Apply these quick wins and track the upswing within a fortnight.

## 1. Categorise Using the STAR System
Run contribution analysis and label dishes as Stars (high popularity, high profit), Plow Horses, Puzzles, or Dogs. Place stars in the sweet spots (upper-right for food, centre for drinks) and remove or reformulate Dogs immediately.

## 2. Use Decoys Wisely
Add a premium anchor dish at the top of each category so the hero dish feels great value. Example: a £38 tomahawk makes the £25 flat-iron look like a steal.

## 3. Design for Flow
- Drop currency symbols and keep prices aligned to reduce sticker shock.
- Use descriptive copy focusing on provenance and preparation.
- Highlight two "landlord picks" with shaded boxes or icons.
- Keep menus short: 6 mains, 4 starters, 4 desserts sell better than encyclopaedias.

## 4. Pair Food and Drink
Add suggested pairings directly beneath dishes ("Pair with Moorland Best, +£5"), or bundle as set menus. Train servers to mention the pairing before leaving the table.

## 5. Introduce Add-On Lines
Offer sauces, sides, and upgrades for every hero dish. A £3 bone marrow butter or £4 truffle chips stack GP without extra labour.

## 6. Update Digital Touchpoints
Sync the website, QR menus, and delivery listings so pricing and descriptions match. Outdated menus kill trust and conversions.

## 7. Train the Team
Host a tasting session so everyone can describe textures, suppliers, and cooking methods with confidence. Provide a cheat sheet with three suggested upsell lines per dish.

## Mini FAQ
**How often should I redesign menus?**
Quarterly for layout tweaks, seasonally for dish rotation. Keep the engineering sheet updated monthly.

**Do printed menus still matter if I use QR codes?**
Yes. Tangible menus let you guide the eye more effectively. Use both and ensure the design language matches.

Menu engineering is silent salesmanship; done well, it boosts spend without a single extra cover.
