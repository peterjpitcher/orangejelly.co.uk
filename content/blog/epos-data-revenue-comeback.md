# Why Your EPOS Data Is the Key to a Revenue Comeback

Your EPOS already knows what sells, when it sells, and what actually makes money. The problem is most pubs stop at the Z report. A simple weekly routine turns data into action and action into revenue.

This is the minimum dashboard and experiment loop that works.

## The four core metrics that matter

Track these every week:
- **Covers** by day and time.
- **Average spend per head**.
- **Gross profit** by category.
- **Labour percentage** by shift.

If you can see these four numbers, you can make better decisions immediately.

## Build a one-page weekly dashboard

Keep it simple. One page, same format, every week. Post it where the team can see it.

Example sections:
- Best and worst day by covers.
- Top five items by margin.
- Slow movers to remove.
- One action for next week.

## Run weekly experiments

Treat each week as a small test. Change one thing and measure the result.

Examples:
- Move a high-margin item to the top of the menu.
- Bundle a drink with a midweek dish.
- Change a price point by one pound and track units.

Small tests beat big, random changes.

## Segment your guests

Split data by time and occasion. A Friday night crowd is not the same as a Tuesday lunch. Build offers for each segment instead of averaging them together.

## Spot hidden profit

Many pubs have a quiet goldmine in one category. It could be premium soft drinks, desserts, or a specific spirit. Identify the top profit items and train the team to recommend them.

## Share insights with the team

Numbers are useless if only one person sees them. Share the weekly dashboard and agree one focus for the next seven days.

## Common mistakes

- Tracking too many metrics.
- Making changes without measuring.
- Ignoring labour cost by shift.
- Leaving slow movers on the menu for months.

## Quick checklist

- One-page dashboard built.
- Four core metrics tracked weekly.
- One experiment run per week.
- Top profit items promoted by staff.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need complex software?**
No. A spreadsheet and your EPOS exports are enough.

**How fast can data improve revenue?**
Often within two weeks if you focus on one lever at a time.
