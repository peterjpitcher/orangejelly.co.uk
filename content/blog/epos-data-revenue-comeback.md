# Why Your EPOS Data Is the Key to a Revenue Comeback

Your EPOS already knows who spends what, when, and on which products. Most landlords just never look beyond the daily Z report. Here is how to turn that data into action.

## The Four Core Metrics
1. **Covers**: number of transactions, split by daypart. Shows demand trends.
2. **Average Spend**: gross sales divided by covers. Highlights upsell success or failure.
3. **Product Mix**: reveals which items deserve promotion or retirement.
4. **Labour %**: wages divided by net sales. Keeps staffing honest.

Pull these weekly and plot against targets on a single-page dashboard.

## Run Weekly Experiments
Use the data to set one focus per week:
- If lunch covers drop, test a new bundle and track conversion.
- If average spend stalls, push dessert sampling and measure uplift.
- If labour % spikes, adjust shift patterns and watch the next report.

Document hypotheses and results in a simple log so learning compounds.

## Segment Your Guests
Tag transactions by channel (walk-in, bookings, delivery) or segment (locals club, hotel guests). Compare spend patterns and design targeted offers based on actual behaviour rather than guesswork.

## Spot Hidden Gold
- Identify the top ten products by GP contribution and give them prime menu placement.
- Find the most profitable hour of the week and throw staff, marketing, and events behind it.
- Highlight staff members with the highest average ticket to turn them into trainers.

## Share Insights With the Team
Print the dashboard and review it at Monday stand-up. Assign ownership: "Sarah, you own average spend." Accountability beats mystery.

## Mini FAQ
**Do I need fancy BI tools?**
No. Most EPOS export CSVs you can drop into Google Sheets. Once the process sticks, explore tools like Tenzo or Forth.

**How do I keep data clean?**
Insist staff use correct buttons, close tabs nightly, and audit discounts weekly. Garbage in equals garbage out.

EPOS data is your free consultant. Check it weekly, act on it daily, and the comeback accelerates.
