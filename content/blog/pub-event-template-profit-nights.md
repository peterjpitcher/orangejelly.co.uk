# The Ultimate Pub Event Template for Guaranteed Profit Nights

Events only work when they are structured. This template turns any activation into a repeatable profit night by locking in pricing, staffing, marketing, and post-event follow up.

Use this as your standard run sheet for any event.

## Six-week timeline

**Week 6-4: Confirm the concept**
- Choose one clear theme.
- Set capacity and price.
- Build the offer and the run time.

**Week 4-2: Launch and book**
- Open bookings with a deposit.
- Announce the event across all channels.
- Confirm suppliers and staff roles.

**Week 2-0: Execute and sell**
- Run a content push.
- Brief the team with scripts.
- Lock the final headcount.

## Pricing formula

Use a simple formula to protect margin:

`(cost of goods + labor uplift + overhead buffer) / target GP = ticket price`

Add a small buffer for no-shows or late changes.

## Staffing and ops

- Assign a host, a bar lead, and a floor lead.
- Create a short run sheet with times and cues.
- Pre-batch anything that can be prepped.

## Promotion stack

- One main social post per week.
- Two stories per week with availability.
- One direct message or email to past guests.
- A sign on the bar and a table tent on every table.

## On-the-night playbook

- Welcome and explain the flow.
- Collect content early.
- Upsell one add-on (dessert, premium pour, or merch).
- Close with a clear next-event teaser.

## Post-event

- Send a thank you message within 24 hours.
- Ask for reviews.
- Offer priority access to the next event.

## Common mistakes

- No capacity cap.
- Pricing without margin math.
- Forgetting to promote after the first announcement.

## Quick checklist

- Capacity and price set.
- Roles assigned.
- Booking link live with deposit.
- Run sheet printed.
- Post-event follow up scheduled.

## Mini FAQ

**Do I need a big event every month?**
No. One strong, repeatable event can outperform a busy calendar.

**Should I ticket or take walk-ins?**
Ticketing gives you predictability and cash. Walk-ins can be a bonus if you keep space.
