# The Ultimate Pub Event Template for Guaranteed Profit Nights

Events either make the till sing or drain staff for nothing. Use this repeatable template to ensure every quiz, tasting, or takeover generates cash and momentum.

## Six-Week Timeline
- **Week 6**: pick the concept, secure host/partners, set profit target (ticket GP + incremental spend).
- **Week 5**: shoot promo assets, design ticket page, confirm supplier contributions.
- **Week 4**: announce to loyalty list, launch early-bird tickets covering baseline costs.
- **Week 3**: widen to social ads, local press, and community boards.
- **Week 2**: share behind-the-scenes content, release seating map, and upsell add-ons.
- **Week 1**: final countdown posts, staff briefing, prep checklists.

## Pricing Formula
(Total Costs + Desired Profit) / Minimum Tickets = Ticket Price. Costs include entertainment, extra labour, ingredients, marketing, and contingency. Sell premium add-ons (welcome cocktail, merch, reserved booth) to boost margin without raising general admission.

## Staffing & Ops
- Assign an event lead who owns the run sheet.
- Draft a minute-by-minute schedule covering sound checks, food pass, competitions, and last orders.
- Prepare a "What if" list (power loss, weather, no-shows) with assigned responses.

## Promotion Stack
1. Email list with personal note from landlord.
2. Printed flyers for the bar and partner venues.
3. Paid ads targeting interest groups (board games, craft beer, etc.).
4. WhatsApp broadcast to loyalty members with first dibs.
5. Short-form video teasers and live countdowns.

## On-the-Night Playbook
- Greet every guest personally, scan tickets, and hand them a schedule.
- Capture content: dedicated team member filming reactions, testimonials, and B-roll.
- Drop subtle CTAs for the next event and offer pre-sale discounts before people leave.

## Post-Event
- Send thank-you emails within 12 hours including photo gallery and feedback link.
- Publish a recap reel tagging partners and guests.
- Debrief with the team: what worked, what to tweak, profit achieved vs target.

## Mini FAQ
**What if tickets are slow?**
Bundle with a friend offer, partner with a local club, or add a charity component. Increase urgency by showing real-time seat counts.

**How do I keep staffing costs down?**
Cross-train team members to handle multiple stations, use volunteer ambassadors (offer future perks), and close non-essential areas of the pub during the event.

Follow the template religiously and events become a predictable profit pillar rather than a gamble.
