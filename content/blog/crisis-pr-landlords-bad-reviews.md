# Crisis PR for Landlords: Turning Bad Reviews into Bookings

A one-star rant can tank bookings faster than a warm fridge. The solution is not defensiveness but speed, facts, and a public comeback. Follow this protocol whenever a review goes nuclear.

## Step 1: Screenshot and Share Internally
Capture the review before it changes, post it in your management chat, and assign an owner to respond. Emotion stays offline; analysis happens internally.

## Step 2: Respond Within 12 Hours
Structure your reply:
1. Thank them for flagging the issue.
2. Apologise sincerely for the specific failure.
3. Explain the fix (or when it will happen).
4. Invite them to continue the conversation privately (email or phone).
5. Sign off with a name and title – faceless replies breed distrust.

## Step 3: Investigate Ruthlessly
Interview the shift team, pull CCTV if needed, and check temp logs or ticket histories. Identify whether it was a process failure, training gap, or genuine guest mismatch. Document the fix and add it to SOPs.

## Step 4: Close the Loop With the Reviewer
Call them. Listen fully, offer to host them again, and outline what has changed. Most angry guests simply wanted to be heard; give them that respect.

## Step 5: Publish the Comeback
Once the fix is live, share it: "You asked for hotter plates – we invested in new lamps" or "After feedback, we've added a gluten-safe prep station". Use stories, reels, email newsletters, and in-venue signage. Show, do not just tell.

## Step 6: Flood the Feed With Fresh Love
Within the next two weeks, ask 20 happy guests for Google reviews, run a "Meet the Team" series, and collect testimonials from community partners. Positive content outruns the negative when you feed the algorithm.

## Mini FAQ
**Should I offer refunds in public?**
No. Move to private channels before discussing compensation. Public refunds encourage opportunists.

**What if the review is fake?**
Flag it with the platform, but still post a calm response explaining you cannot find the booking and inviting the writer to contact you. Onlookers see your professionalism.

Handled well, a bad review becomes proof that you listen, improve, and care more than the average chain.
