# Crisis PR for Landlords: Turning Bad Reviews into Bookings

A brutal review can kill bookings in hours. The fix is not defensiveness, it is speed, transparency, and a public recovery plan. The response is part of the marketing now, because future guests read how you handle mistakes.

This is a practical protocol you can follow every time a review goes nuclear.

## Step 1: Capture and calm

Screenshot the review and share it internally. Do not reply in anger. Give yourself a short pause so you can respond with control, not ego.

## Step 2: Respond within 12 hours

Speed matters. A clear, calm response reduces damage and signals accountability.

Example response:
"Hi Jamie, thanks for sharing this. I am genuinely sorry your visit fell short. I have spoken to the team and we are fixing the issues you raised. If you are open to it, please email me directly so I can make this right. Peter."

Keep it short. Own the issue. Offer a path to resolution.

## Step 3: Investigate fast and publicly

Find the root cause. Was it a staffing gap, a supplier issue, or a process failure? Once you know, explain the fix in public language.

Example:
"We were short in the kitchen that night and let orders stack up. We have now added a second cook on Saturdays and shortened the menu during peak service."

## Step 4: Close the loop with the reviewer

If they respond, make it right. A corrected mistake can become a loyal regular. Use a clear offer and a friendly tone.

- Invite them back with a specific time.
- Give a small but meaningful gesture (a round, a dessert, a table reservation).

## Step 5: Flood the feed with fresh proof

The fastest way to bury a bad review is to earn ten good ones. Ask happy guests for reviews for two weeks. Make it part of the service routine.

Simple script: "If you had a good time tonight, a quick review helps local pubs like ours more than you would believe."

## Step 6: Publish the comeback

Share a short update on socials or your website about the fix. Not defensive, just transparent.

Example:
"We heard your feedback about slow service last weekend. We have added another team member on Saturdays and tightened the menu for faster delivery. Thank you for pushing us to improve."

## Common mistakes

- Arguing with the reviewer.
- Writing a long essay response.
- Ignoring reviews for days.
- Promising fixes you do not implement.

## Quick checklist

- Respond in under 12 hours.
- Confirm the root cause within 24 hours.
- Publish the fix publicly.
- Request reviews from happy guests for two weeks.

## Mini FAQ

**Should I offer a refund publicly?**
Offer a private resolution. Public refunds can encourage repeat complaints.

**What if the review is fake?**
Respond politely, state you cannot find a record, and invite them to contact you directly.
