# Premium Tasting Nights - The Anchor

## The Problem

We needed events that would bring in new customers and create regulars. Generic events weren't working, and we didn't have the expertise to run sophisticated tasting evenings. How could we create premium events that justified higher ticket pricing while ensuring people would come back?

## The Solution

Created a quarterly series: gin, rum, tequila, and winter warmers tastings. Partnered with Greene King to connect with premium brands. Tickets include spirits, mixers, and a themed meal. Limited availability to create exclusivity. Added educational elements and mini-quiz with prizes. Used AI for sophisticated marketing and follow-up campaigns.

## Results

- **Retention**: Strong repeat attendance
- **Ticket Sales**: Near sellout every event
- **Revenue**: Premium pricing plus bar sales
- **Reach**: New customers added each time
