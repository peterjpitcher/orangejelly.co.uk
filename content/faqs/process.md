# Process FAQs

## How do we get started?

Message me on WhatsApp with your biggest bottleneck. We start by identifying the highest-impact next move and building from there.

## How quickly can we see progress?

Most partners see early movement in days, then meaningful momentum over the first 30 days with consistent execution.

## Do I need paid advertising?

Not to start. We focus on practical organic wins first. Paid support can be layered in when it makes commercial sense.

## What if we are short on time?

That is normal in hospitality. We build simple weekly rhythms, quick wins, and practical systems your team can actually run.

## Do you offer fixed packages?

No. Support is £75 per hour plus VAT. You pay for progress and experience, not overhead-heavy retainers.

## Are you remote or on-site?

Both. Most work can be delivered remotely. On-site support is possible when useful.

## What does "disruptive" mean in your approach?

It means disrupting outdated marketing habits, not disrupting your operation. Disruptive thinking, safe execution.
