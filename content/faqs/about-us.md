# About Us FAQs

## Who is Peter Pitcher and why should I trust Orange Jelly?

I'm Peter Pitcher. Billy runs The Anchor in Stanwell Moor day-to-day, and I lead marketing and growth. Orange Jelly exists to share practical, proven hospitality growth systems built in real trading conditions.

## What makes Orange Jelly different from a typical agency?

We are a small team on purpose. You work directly with us. No layers, no account manager handoffs, no generic retainer theatre. Your investment goes into practical progress.

## Is Orange Jelly a big company?

No. We are a very small, hands-on team. That keeps communication direct, decisions fast, and support practical.

## What do you mean by transformative marketing?

Transformative means a step-change in outcomes, not just more activity. We focus on measurable improvements in bookings, footfall, repeat visits, and revenue.

## Do you only work with pubs?

No. We work with hospitality partners including pubs, bars, restaurants, venues, hotels, and event spaces.

## Is your approach only about AI?

No. AI is one practical tool inside a wider action-first approach. We only use tools that improve speed and consistency without adding complexity.

## Can I visit The Anchor to see your approach in action?

Yes. You are welcome to visit and see how we run practical systems in a live venue.
