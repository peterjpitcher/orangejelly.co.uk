# About Us FAQs

## Who is Peter Pitcher and why should I trust Orange Jelly?

I'm Peter Pitcher. Billy runs The Anchor pub in Stanwell Moor day-to-day, and I handle marketing and business development around my full-time role as an AI Marketing Capabilities Lead for a global food manufacturer. I've been an early AI adopter since 2021 and discovered how AI can add 25 hours of value per week. Orange Jelly exists to share these proven strategies with fellow licensees.

## What makes Orange Jelly different from other consultants?

We're not consultants who've never pulled a pint. We run an actual pub and test every strategy in our own business first. No corporate nonsense, no jargon - just one licensee helping another with tools that actually work. We don't do refunds—we stay involved until the work delivers real-world results.

## Is Orange Jelly a big company?

No, Orange Jelly started in 2016 with Laura Willis as a digital agency, then pivoted in 2019. Now it's just me (Peter) working around my full-time job while Billy runs The Anchor day-to-day. No big office, no sales team. This means you get personal service, honest advice, and someone who genuinely understands your challenges because I face them too.

## Why is it called Orange Jelly?

Just a fun play on words in a world that's ever-changing! We wanted a name that's friendly, memorable, and doesn't take itself too seriously - just like us. It reflects our approach: making complicated things simple and approachable.

## Can I visit The Anchor to see your strategies in action?

Absolutely! We'd love to show you around. Pop in for a pint and see how we use AI tools in real pub operations. First pint's on me if you mention Orange Jelly. We're at Horton Road, Stanwell Moor, Staines TW19 6AQ.

## How did you discover AI could help pubs?

Through my curiosity for technology and being an early adopter. I started with ChatGPT in 2021 when it first launched. The early results were terrible, but as the models evolved, they became business-ready. Now AI helps us unlock 25 hours of value per week in the pub.

## Do you understand the challenges of running a small pub?

Completely. We've dealt with empty Monday nights, staff no-shows, supplier price hikes, TripAdvisor nightmares, and competing with Wetherspoons. That's why our solutions are practical, affordable, and designed for real pub life.

## Is Orange Jelly just about AI and technology?

No, it's about giving you your life back. AI is just the tool - the real goal is helping you work less and earn more. Whether that's automating social media so you can have Sunday lunch with family, or creating menus that sell themselves so you're not stressing about GP.
