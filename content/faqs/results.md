# Results FAQs

## What results have you achieved at The Anchor?

At The Anchor we now see 25-30 regular quiz teams each month, cut Sunday waste by £250/week, reduced supplier/rota/energy costs by £4,000+ per month, and improved operational consistency with practical AI-enabled systems.

## How quickly can outcomes improve?

You can often see early movement in days. We usually target meaningful, measurable momentum over the first 30 days.

## Do you focus on vanity metrics?

No. We focus on outcomes that matter commercially: bookings, footfall, repeat visits, event demand, and conversion from visibility.

## Will the same approach work for every venue?

The principles are consistent, but execution is tailored to each partner's goals, audience, and operating reality.

## What if results are slower than expected?

We review weekly, adjust quickly, and keep attention on the highest-impact priorities so momentum stays moving.

## Can I see examples before we start?

Yes. Our Results page shows practical case examples from The Anchor and the methods we apply with partners.
