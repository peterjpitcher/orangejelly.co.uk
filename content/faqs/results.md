# Results FAQs

## What results have you achieved at The Anchor?

We've improved food GP from 58% to 71%, grown quiz nights to 25-35 regulars, achieve 60,000-70,000 social media views monthly, and added £75,000-£100,000 of value to our business using AI. Most importantly - we got our evenings back. Every strategy we share has delivered real results in our own pub.

## How quickly will I see more customers from the recovery plan?

Results vary by pub, but at The Anchor we've seen quiz nights grow from 20 to 25-35 regulars, tasting nights with 85% retention, and 60,000-70,000 social media views monthly. Most improvements show within 30 days.

## How quickly can I see results for my empty pub?

Most pubs see 25-40% increase in covers within 30 days. Our proven system starts working immediately - you'll notice more bookings in week one, busier nights by week two, and significantly fuller tables by day 30.

## How long until free marketing shows results?

Everything we do is built around a 30-day turnaround. Some actions, like fixing your Google listing, can spark enquiries within hours, while social posts and email campaigns build momentum over the first couple of weeks. The compounding effect becomes obvious by the end of the month.

## What's your success rate with pub turnarounds?

We've helped transform pubs from empty to thriving. Our own pub, The Anchor, went from 45 to 65 Sunday covers and doubled Tuesday night revenue. Every strategy we recommend has been tested in real pub conditions.

## How quickly will I see midweek improvements?

Inside 30 days. Expect to feel the first lift in bookings during week two, then hit 60-70% capacity on the nights that used to be empty by the end of the month. The Anchor went from 20 to 85 people for Tuesday quiz in 6 weeks by sticking with this cadence.

## What if your solutions don't work for my pub?

Every pub is different, which is why we stay closely involved during the first month. Weekly check-ins, rapid adjustments, and direct WhatsApp access mean we keep iterating until it works. These strategies are based on real pub experience, not theory.

## How can menu descriptions increase my food sales?

Psychology-based menu descriptions guide customers to order more profitable dishes and increase average spend by £7 per table. We use proven techniques like sensory language, storytelling, and strategic positioning that have increased food GP by up to 15% for our clients.

## Can AI help with supplier negotiations?

Yes! AI analyzes your purchasing patterns, compares supplier prices, and identifies savings opportunities. I've saved £250/week on food waste alone by optimizing our ordering based on AI predictions.

## Can AI predict which events will be successful?

Yes! By analyzing local demographics, past event performance, and social media engagement, AI helps predict which events will draw crowds. It's helped us avoid costly flops and double down on winners.

## How quickly will I see results?

At The Anchor, our first AI-powered quiz night brought in 35 people instead of the usual 20 during the first week. Clients feel similar early wins, but the commitment we make is a full turnaround inside 30 days. You won't wait months wondering if it's working.

## Can I see examples of your work?

Visit The Anchor's social media pages - everything you see there, I created using the same tools I'll teach you. 60,000+ views monthly, quiz nights up 40%, food GP improved from 58% to 71%. That's not theory - that's our actual pub.
