# Service FAQs

## What areas does Orange Jelly cover?

For in-person training and consultations, we cover a 30-mile radius from Stanwell Moor (Surrey, Berkshire, West London). For online services like marketing and menu design, we help pubs across the UK. Technology means distance isn't a barrier.

## How can I be sure Orange Jelly will work for my pub?

Every pub is different, but the challenges are similar. That's why we offer a free consultation to understand your specific situation and stay closely involved during the first month to keep things on track. We're so confident because these aren't theories - they're proven strategies from our own pub.

## What's your promise to pub owners?

To help you claw back up to 25 hours every week on admin tasks, be honest about what AI can and can't do, only recommend tools we use ourselves, keep prices transparent and fair, and provide personal support when you need it.

## Can AI really manage my pub's social media?

Yes - we reach 60,000-70,000 people every month and plan and schedule 30 days of social content in 2 hours. I'll train you on the exact AI tools and prompts I use, so you can achieve similar results without the time drain.

## How detailed are your AI business reports?

Very detailed but easy to understand. You'll get insights on customer behavior, menu performance, event ROI, and seasonal trends - all presented in plain English with clear action steps.

## What makes your event planning different?

Real experience combined with AI efficiency. I've run successful quiz nights, tasting events, and seasonal promotions. I'll share what works and train you to use AI for promotion and management.

## How does the Empty Pub Recovery Plan work?

We work with you to implement AI-powered marketing strategies that have been proven at The Anchor. Think of it as a playbook we customise for your pub, not a pre-set package. We charge £75 per hour plus VAT, tailoring the time to exactly what your business needs.

## How do you promote a pub quiz effectively?

Through AI-powered social media campaigns, automated reminders, and community engagement. Our quiz attendance now sits at 25-30 regular teams every month using these exact methods - I'll show you how to replicate this success.

## What's the secret to quiz night success?

AI automation for consistent promotion, WhatsApp groups for regular attendees, and prize structures that encourage teams. We now see 25-30 regular teams every month with these methods.

## Can AI really help with quiz nights?

Absolutely! AI helps create engaging promotional content, manage bookings, send reminders, and even generate fresh quiz questions. It's transformed our Tuesday nights from empty to buzzing.

## Will my social media posts look automated?

Not at all! I'll teach you to guide AI to create posts that sound like you, showcase your pub's personality, and engage your local community. Our posts get more engagement now than when we spent hours writing them manually.

## What kind of business insights can AI provide?

AI helps analyze your sales patterns, identify your most profitable customers, optimize staff scheduling, and predict busy periods. Estimated business value added since adopting AI: £75,000-£100,000.

## What exactly do you do with menu AI?

I'll teach you to use AI for menu analysis, pricing optimization, and seasonal updates. We've cut £250/week in Sunday waste and reduced food waste by 90% using AI-driven prep forecasts.

## Will AI-written menus sound fake or robotic?

Not at all! I guide the AI to write in your pub's authentic voice. The descriptions feel personal and appetizing - customers often comment on how good our food sounds before they've even tasted it.

## How do you create pub events that actually work?

By using AI to analyze what your community wants, automate promotion, and track results. Our tasting nights build strong repeat attendance because we use data to plan events people actually want to attend.

## Do you work with chains or just independents?

Both. We support independent pubs and pub chain teams. Whether you're a family-run free house or part of a larger group, if you want to fill your pub and save up to 25 hours every week, I can help.

## What areas do you cover?

Everywhere. Most work is done remotely via video calls and screen sharing. I can show you exactly what to do from my screen to yours. For local pubs in Surrey/Berkshire, I can visit in person.

## What events actually work for midweek?

Quiz nights (done right) can pull strong midweek turnout. Steak nights, curry clubs, and wine tastings work brilliantly. The key is consistency, proper promotion, and making it unmissable. We'll show you exactly how.

## How do I stop losing customers to cheaper chain pubs?

Create experiences chains can't match. Regular's benefits, personalized service, quality food, unique events, and genuine community feel. Make your pub irreplaceable, not just another place to drink.

## What free marketing works best for pubs?

Social media (especially local Facebook groups), Google My Business optimization, email marketing to existing customers, community partnerships, and creating shareable moments. These strategies consistently outperform paid ads for local pubs.
