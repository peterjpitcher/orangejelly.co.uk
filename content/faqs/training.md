# Training FAQs

## What will I learn in the AI training for licensees?

How to unlock 25 hours of value per week using AI: create rotas in minutes, write menus that sell, plan and schedule 30 days of social content in 2 hours (reaching 60,000-70,000 people every month at The Anchor), handle bookings while you sleep, and use AI for all the boring bits so you can focus on customers. No tech knowledge needed.

## Is AI training suitable for someone who's not tech-savvy?

Absolutely! We're licensees, not tech experts. Our training is designed for busy pub owners who want practical solutions, not complicated technology. We focus on simple tools that accelerate execution immediately.
