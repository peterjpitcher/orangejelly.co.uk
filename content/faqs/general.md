Every strategy has been proven at The Anchor where we've been implementing AI solutions since 2021. I offer a free consultation to discuss your specific challenges and show you exactly how we've solved similar problems.

At The Anchor, most improvements showed inside 30 days once we got consistent. Your timeline depends on your starting point, offer, catchment, and how quickly you can implement.

## Do I need to understand technology to work with Orange Jelly?

Not at all! We handle all the technical bits. You just serve the extra customers. We're licensees ourselves - we know you're too busy for complicated tech. Everything we do is designed to be simple and hands-off for you.

## How does Orange Jelly use AI for pub marketing?

We use AI to plan and schedule 30 days of social media content in 2 hours, write menu descriptions that sell, analyse competitor strategies, automate booking responses, and optimise pricing. It's about working smarter, not harder.

## What if I'm not happy with the results?

We stay closely involved during the first month with weekly check-ins, fast adjustments, and direct WhatsApp support so you can see momentum quickly. These strategies work because we use them in our own pub.

## Do you offer payment plans?

Yes, we offer flexible payment plans to spread the cost. We understand cash flow challenges in hospitality. Let's discuss what works for your budget - most invoices can be split into two or three monthly payments.

## Can I pick and mix services?

Of course. Every pub has different needs. Start with your biggest pain point, then add more services as needed once you've built momentum.

## How is Orange Jelly different from other marketing agencies?

We actually run a pub - The Anchor in Stanwell Moor. Billy handles day-to-day operations while I handle marketing and business development. Every strategy we recommend has been tested in our own business first.

## What makes Orange Jelly different from other pub marketing agencies?

We actually run a pub - The Anchor in Stanwell Moor. Billy handles day-to-day operations while I handle marketing and business development. Every strategy we recommend has been tested in our own business first. We're not an agency; I'm a licensee who understands your challenges because I face them too. Plus I still work full-time, so I know about juggling everything.

## What advantages do independent pubs have over chains?

Personal service, flexibility, local knowledge, unique atmosphere, better quality, community connection, and the ability to adapt quickly. Chains are slow corporate machines - you can outmaneuver them every time.

## What if I've tried everything and nothing works?

We hear this a lot. The difference is we're licensees who've solved this exact problem. Our strategies aren't theories - they're proven methods that transformed The Anchor's quiet nights into profitable evenings.

## Can a small pub really compete with big chains?

Absolutely. David beats Goliath when he's smart. At The Anchor, we compete successfully with nearby chains. The key is playing to your strengths, not trying to beat them at their game.

## Can I really market my pub without spending money?

Absolutely. The best pub marketing is often free - word of mouth, social media, community partnerships, and email marketing cost nothing but time. We filled The Anchor using mostly free strategies before investing in paid advertising.

## Why is my pub so quiet Monday to Thursday?

Most pubs rely on weekend trade and hope midweek 'sorts itself out'. It won't. Quiet weeknights need specific strategies: targeted offers, the right events, and messaging that gives people a reason to leave the house on a Tuesday.

## Do you really understand what I'm going through?

Absolutely. The Anchor was in terrible physical state when we took over in March 2019 - leaking roof, no insulation, paper rotas. We've dealt with everything: staff walking out mid-shift, supplier nightmares, fierce competition. That's why Orange Jelly exists - to help you avoid our mistakes.

## How is Orange Jelly different from other consultants?

I'm not a consultant - I'm a licensee working alongside a real pub operator. Billy runs The Anchor day-to-day and I handle marketing and business development. No suits, no PowerPoints, no corporate jargon. Just practical help from someone who understands because I'm dealing with the same challenges. Plus, we use AI to accelerate the boring bits so your team can focus on growth.

## Will this work for my type of pub?

Yes. The principles work for gastropubs, community locals, sports bars, and country inns because they're based on human psychology and proven hospitality fundamentals. We'll tailor the plan to your pub and your catchment.

## Can I see examples of your work?

Visit The Anchor! See our menus, watch our social media in action, attend a quiz night. Everything I teach, we use daily. First pint's on me - seeing is believing.
