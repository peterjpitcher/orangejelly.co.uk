# Pricing FAQs

## How does your hourly consulting work?

We charge £75 per hour plus VAT as a flat rate. I'll work with you to implement the AI strategies that have transformed The Anchor - from social media automation to event planning. First training session with a pub chain scheduled September 2025.

## What exactly do you do for £75 per hour?

Everything from writing your social media posts to designing menus that sell. I can create quiz nights that pack your pub, write emails that get opened, fix your Google listing so locals find you, or teach you AI tools that save up to 25 hours a week. You tell me what's hurting your business most - I'll fix it using methods proven at The Anchor.

## Why £75 per hour? Why not packages?

Because your pub doesn't need what every other pub needs. Maybe you just need 3 hours to fix your dead Monday nights. Maybe you need 20 hours for a complete marketing overhaul. Pay for exactly what you need, nothing more.

## What if it doesn't work?

We stay hands-on through the first 30 days with weekly check-ins, rapid adjustments, and direct WhatsApp support. In 6 years at The Anchor, these strategies have never failed when properly implemented.

## How much does the empty pub recovery plan cost?

£75 per hour plus VAT. It's the same hourly support, just organised into a focused 30-day plan so you only pay for what your pub actually needs.

## How much revenue am I losing on quiet nights?

A pub doing 20 covers on a Tuesday instead of 60 loses £1,200 that night. Over a month, that's £4,800. Over a year? £57,600 in lost revenue just from Tuesday nights alone.

## What if I can't afford consultancy fees right now?

I get it - when the pub's struggling, every penny counts. We charge £75 per hour plus VAT, working flexibly with your budget. Most strategies pay for themselves in the first weekend. Plus, I'll often share free tips during our first chat because I hate seeing pubs struggle.

## Will discounting hurt my weekend trade?

No, if done correctly. Smart midweek offers bring in different customers at different times. We'll show you how to create compelling offers that fill quiet periods without cannibalizing busy times.

## Why don't you offer fixed-price packages?

Every pub is unique. Fixed packages force you to pay for things you don't need. At £75 per hour plus VAT, you only pay for the help you actually use. Most pubs see significant improvements within 20-30 hours of consulting.

## How can I compete with chain pubs on price?

You don't compete on price - you compete on value. Chain pub customers aren't always your customers. Focus on quality, atmosphere, personal service, and community connection. We'll show you how to position your pub as the premium local choice.

## Should I match chain pub prices?

No. Racing to the bottom kills profits. Instead, justify your prices with superior quality, service, and experience. Our strategies help you attract customers who value quality over cheapness.
