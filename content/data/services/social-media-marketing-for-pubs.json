      "question": "Do I need to hire someone to run it?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. With templates and batching, your team can run it in short sessions. Hands-on support is optional."

    {
      "question": "Will this work without paid ads?",
      "answer": "Yes. We focus on organic wins first: local engagement, clear offers, and consistency. Paid can amplify later."

      "question": "How quickly will I see results?",
