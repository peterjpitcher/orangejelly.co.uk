      "question": "Is Orange Jelly a big company?",
      "answer": "No, Orange Jelly started in 2016 with Laura Willis as a digital agency, then pivoted in 2019.

    },
    {
      "question": "How did you discover AI could help pubs?",
      "answer": "Through my curiosity for technology and being an early adopter. I started with ChatGPT in 2021 when it first launched. The early results were terrible, but as the models evolved, they became business-ready. Now AI helps us unlock 25 hours of value per week in the pub."
    },
    {
      "question": "What results have you achieved at The Anchor?",
      "answer": "We reach 60,000-70,000 people every month on social media, our quiz nights now attract 25-30 regular teams each month, we've cut £250/week in Sunday waste and £4,000+ a month in supplier, rota, and energy costs, and added £75,000-£100,000 of value to our business using AI. Most importantly - we got our evenings back. Every strategy we share has delivered real results in our own pub."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you understand the challenges of running a small pub?",
      "answer": "Completely. We've dealt with empty Monday nights, staff no-shows, supplier price hikes, TripAdvisor nightmares, and competing with Wetherspoons. That's why our solutions are practical, affordable, and designed for real pub life."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Orange Jelly just about AI and technology?",
      "answer": "No, it's about giving you your life back. AI is just the tool - the real goal is helping you work less and earn more. Whether that's automating social media so you can have Sunday lunch with family, or creating menus that sell themselves so you're not stressing about GP."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I be sure Orange Jelly will work for my pub?",
      "answer": "Every pub is different, but the challenges are similar. That's why we offer a free consultation to understand your specific situation and stay hands-on through the first month so adjustments happen quickly. These aren't theories - they're proven strategies from our own pub."
    },
    {
      "question": "What areas does Orange Jelly cover?",
      "answer": "For in-person training and consultations, we cover a 30-mile radius from Stanwell Moor (Surrey, Berkshire, West London). For online services like marketing and menu design, we help pubs across the UK. Technology means distance isn't a barrier."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your promise to pub owners?",
      "answer": "To help you claw back up to 25 hours every week on admin tasks, be honest about what AI can and can't do, only recommend tools we use ourselves, keep prices transparent and fair, and provide personal support when you need it."
