    {
      "question": "How does the Empty Pub Recovery Plan work?",
      "answer": "We start with a free consultation to understand your specific challenges. Then I create a custom 30-day action plan using strategies that worked at The Anchor. You get weekly check-ins, AI tools access, and my personal WhatsApp for questions. Most pubs see increased footfall inside that first month."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does your hourly consulting work?",
      "answer": "Simple - you only pay for the time you need. No packages, no minimum contracts. We agree on what needs doing, I track my time, and invoice you monthly. Most pubs start with a small block of time and scale as needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see more customers from the recovery plan?",
      "answer": "Most pubs see meaningful, bankable progress inside 30 days. Week 1 brings more website traffic and calls, week 2 is for tuning before promising busier nights, and by week 4 you should notice fuller evenings and consistent enquiries. The Anchor now sees 25-30 regular quiz teams each month when we stick to the system."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can menu descriptions increase my food sales?",
      "answer": "Psychology-based descriptions trigger hunger and justify higher prices. 'Fish & chips' becomes 'Beer-battered Atlantic cod with triple-cooked chips and mushy peas'. Same dish, stronger margins, customers happier."
    },
    {
      "question": "What exactly do you do with menu AI?",
      "answer": "I use AI to analyze your menu, identify profit opportunities, and create mouth-watering descriptions. We'll optimize pricing, highlight high-margin items, and create seasonal variations. Takes 2 hours what used to take days, and sells better."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will AI-written menus sound fake or robotic?",
      "answer": "Not at all. I train the AI with your pub's personality and local dialect. The descriptions sound like you wrote them on your best day. Customers won't know it's AI - they'll just know they want to order everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you promote a pub quiz effectively?",
      "answer": "Multi-channel approach: AI-generated social posts 3x weekly, WhatsApp broadcasts to regulars, table talkers, and strategic partnerships with local businesses. We track what works and double down. Our quiz now attracts 25-30 regular teams every month using this system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the secret to quiz night success?",
      "answer": "Consistency, community, and clever marketing. Same night, same time, build traditions. Use AI for questions so you're not scrambling. Food deals that make sense (not giving away profit). Most importantly - make it an event, not just a quiz."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI really help with quiz nights?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. AI generates themed rounds in seconds, creates promotional content, analyzes which questions work best, and even suggests food pairings. Preparation drops from hours to minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI really manage my pub's social media?",
      "answer": "AI doesn't manage it - you do, with AI doing the heavy lifting. I teach you to plan and schedule 30 days of content in 2 hours, schedule it automatically, and track what works. You stay in control while saving up to 25 hours every week on admin tasks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my social media posts look automated?",
      "answer": "No - they'll look better than before. AI helps create engaging content that sounds like you on your most creative day. Mix in real photos from your pub, and nobody knows the difference. We reach 60,000-70,000 people every month this way."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not tech-savvy?",
      "answer": "Perfect - neither was I! If you can use WhatsApp, you can use these tools. I provide step-by-step videos, personal training, and ongoing support. Most clients are creating AI content within 2 hours of training."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of business insights can AI provide?",
      "answer": "AI reveals patterns humans miss: optimal pricing, quiet period opportunities, menu performance, staff scheduling efficiency, and customer behavior trends. Estimated business value added since adopting AI: £75,000-£100,000."
    },
    {
      "question": "How detailed are your AI business reports?",
      "answer": "As detailed as you want. From simple weekly dashboards to deep-dive analysis of every transaction. I'll teach you to generate reports that actually help make decisions, not just pretty graphs that mean nothing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI help with supplier negotiations?",
      "answer": "Yes! AI analyzes your purchasing history, compares supplier prices, identifies over-ordering, and suggests negotiation points. We cut £250/week in Sunday waste and £4,000+ a month in supplier, rota, and energy costs using AI insights."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you create pub events that actually work?",
      "answer": "Start with data - what does your community actually want? Use AI to analyze local trends, create compelling promotions, and track what works. Our gin tasting sells out because we know exactly what our customers want before they do."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your event planning different?",
      "answer": "I've run events that flopped and events that sold out fast. I'll share both lessons. Plus, AI tools for promotion, booking management, and follow-up that turn one-time attendees into regulars."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI predict which events will be successful?",
      "answer": "AI analyzes local trends, competitor events, weather patterns, and your customer data to predict success. Not 100% accurate, but much better than guessing. Planning with AI reduces failed events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why don't you offer fixed-price packages?",
      "answer": "Every pub is different. You might need a few hours of menu help or more time for a full transformation. Hourly billing means you only pay for what you need, and can stop anytime. It's honest and fair."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I see examples of your work?",
      "answer": "Visit The Anchor any Tuesday for quiz night, check our social media @TheAnchorStanwell, or look at our Sunday waste reduction. Better yet, WhatsApp me for a video walkthrough of everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer remote support?",
      "answer": "Yes! Most support is via video calls, screen sharing, and WhatsApp. I'm available 7 days a week. In-person visits available for Surrey pubs, but honestly, remote works just as well and saves you money."
