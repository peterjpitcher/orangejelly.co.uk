    {
      "question": "Can small pubs really compete with chains?",
      "answer": "Not by playing their game. But absolutely yes by playing YOUR game. Chains compete on price and convenience. You compete on experience, community, and personality. Different game, different rules, and you have all the advantages in your game."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if there's a Wetherspoons right next door?",
      "answer": "Perfect! Let them have the price-sensitive customers while you build a community of people who value quality, atmosphere, and personal service. Our Wetherspoons is 200 yards away. We're not competing - we're offering something completely different."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long before I see results?",
      "answer": "Expect encouraging signals during the first couple of weeks as regulars notice the shift, but we design the plan so meaningful, bankable progress lands inside 30 days. By day 60 you've carved out your niche and slowed customer drift to chains, with the 90-day plan locking it in."
    },
    {
      "question": "Won't raising prices drive customers away?",
      "answer": "Only the wrong customers. When you position correctly and deliver unique value, the right customers happily pay more. We charge 40% more than Wetherspoons for similar items. Our customers don't care because they're not buying food - they're buying an experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I've already tried everything?",
      "answer": "You've tried competing with chains on their terms. That never works. This is about completely changing the game. Not better prices or bigger portions - completely different value proposition that chains literally cannot copy even if they wanted to."
