## Draft Email

**Subject: From One Greene King Tenant to Another: How We Fill Empty Tables**

Hi [Name],

I'm Peter Pitcher, licensee of The Anchor in Stanwell Moor - a Greene King tenancy we've run since March 2019. We've cut £250/week in Sunday waste and £4,000+ a month in supplier, rota, and energy costs using AI-driven systems, and I wanted to share how we did it with fellow Greene King pubs.

**I know the challenges you're facing:**
- Empty tables on Tuesday and Wednesday nights
- Pressure to hit increasingly tough GP targets
- Managing costs while competing with Wetherspoons pricing
- Finding time for marketing while running service

**Our journey at The Anchor:**
When we took over, quiz nights were empty. Now we consistently see 25-30 regular teams each month, reach 60,000-70,000 people on social media, and have added £75,000-£100,000 to our business value. Most importantly, we've automated our marketing to save up to 25 hours every week.

**Specific ways we help Greene King pubs:**

1. **Menu Engineering**: Redesign your menu to hit Greene King's GP targets while keeping customers happy. We'll analyse your current offerings and suggest proven high-margin dishes that actually sell.

2. **Midweek Strategies**: Our "Burger & Pint Tuesday" and enhanced quiz nights consistently fill previously empty tables. These aren't generic promotions - they're tested in a real Greene King pub.

3. **Social Media Automation**: Stop spending hours on Facebook. We set up systems that post automatically while maintaining that personal, local pub feel.

4. **Food Promotion Timing**: We've learned exactly when Greene King customers make dining decisions. Our targeted promotion schedule increases covers without discounting.

5. **Community Engagement**: Build a database of regular customers (we have 250 opted-in SMS contacts) who actually come back, not just grab offers and disappear.

6. **Waste Reduction**: Our Sunday lunch prediction model saves us £250 weekly in waste - crucial for hitting those GP targets.

**Why this matters to us:**
As a fellow Greene King tenant, I understand the unique pressures we face - from EHO visits to stocktake requirements to the new menu rollouts. Every strategy we share has been tested within Greene King's systems and constraints. We're not consultants with theories; we're licensees with proof.

**Let's have a chat:**
I'm happy to share specific examples of what's working at The Anchor. No sales pressure - just one Greene King licensee helping another.

Drop me a WhatsApp on 07766 956569 or email peter@orangejelly.co.uk. Even if you just want to commiserate about the latest menu change!
