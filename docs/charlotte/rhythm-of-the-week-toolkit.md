# Rhythm of the Week: turn quiet nights into keepers

> Create a simple “heartbeat” of repeatable activities that keeps the pub lively and tills ringing — without draining the team. From quizzes and music bingo to low-prep tastings and team-friendly formats, here’s how to land ROTW week-in, week-out.

**At a glance**

- **Who it’s for:** Tenanted and leased pubs that want steady midweek trade, predictable ops, and repeatable promos.
- **What you’ll get:** A one-page weekly blueprint, low-prep activation library, deal mechanics, a 90-minute run-sheet, ops checklists, compliance notes, and a lean scorecard.

## Why ROTW works (and how to make it yours)

Routine beats fireworks. When guests know Monday is Team Night Lite and Thursday always has a sports-led hook, they plan you into their week. The team wins too: repeated formats slash setup time, simplify staffing, and make it easier to brief casuals. Keep each activation low-cost, 90 minutes max, and hyper-local. Refresh formats monthly (not daily) so regulars feel a lift without you rebuilding the house every week.

> **Callout — Consistency over spikes:** A reliable Monday or Wednesday is worth more than occasional “big one-offs”.
