## 10 real pub jobs AI can do this week (copy these prompts)

> **How to use:** Open your AI assistant on your phone. Paste the prompt. Replace the [square brackets] with your details. Edit, then post.

1. **Write your weekly “What’s On”**  
   “Write a 120-word ‘What’s On This Week’ for a Greene King tenanted pub in [Town]. Include days/times for [Quiz Tue 19:30–21:00, Karaoke Fri 21:00–23:00, Music Bingo Sun 17:00–18:30], a friendly call to book, and a line about our alcohol-free range. Tone: warm, British hospitality.”

2. **Turn the plan into 3 ready-to-post captions**  
   “Create three social captions for the week above: (1) announce at T-7, (2) reminder at T-2, (3) Tonight. 60–90 words each, 24-hour times, one clear CTA, max two emojis.”

3. **Poster text for Canva**  
   “Draft poster copy for ‘Karaoke Knockout’ on [Fri 7 March 21:00–23:00]. Include three rules, grand-finale note, prize, and a QR line: ‘Scan to book a table’.”

4. **Run-sheet for staff (90 minutes)**  
   “Create a 90-minute run-sheet for Music Bingo in a tenanted pub. Include six beats with timings, who does what (MC/floor/till), mic lines, reset points, prize moment, and one upsell per beat.”

5. **WhatsApp brief to your team**  
   “Write a friendly WhatsApp briefing for staff about tonight’s quiz (19:30–21:00). Include dress code, set-up by 18:45, table talkers out, stamp cards ready, AF draught as the hero serve, and the upsell focus (sharing boards). Keep under 80 words.”

6. **Six Nations matchday captions**  
   “Write one Facebook caption for each of five Six Nations Saturdays. Include kickoff time placeholders, a table-service note for the first 15 minutes after KO, a half-time snack board, and a friendly nudge to book. 60–80 words each.”

7. **Dry January menu micro-copy**  
   “Write a 40-word menu intro that frames alcohol-free as a premium choice, then list five grown-up AF serves with glassware and garnish: AF stout, AF IPA, spritz-style mocktail, 0.0% G&T, AF cider.”

8. **Reply to common DMs**  
   “Draft five short replies (friendly, British) to FAQs: Do you show the rugby? Do you take bookings for 6? Do you have gluten-free options? Is there parking? Can kids come to quiz night?”

9. **Stock & prep checklist**  
   “Create a checklist for a Thursday ‘Try-Day’ tasting: glassware count, drip trays, tasting notes printouts, cask/guest ale POS, AF flight boards, staff script for a 30-second table pitch.”

10. **Next-day ‘thanks + next week’ post**  
    “Write a short ‘Thanks for coming!’ post using a winners’ photo and trail next week’s event. 50–70 words, friendly, ask people to tag themselves.”

## Daily 10-minute routine (print this on the noticeboard)

- **Mon:** Post the “What’s On” and update the chalkboard.  
- **Tue–Thu:** One story + answer messages (use Prompt 8).  
- **Fri:** Check stock/POS for weekend events (Prompt 9).  
- **Sat:** Take one 10–15s portrait clip for next week.  
- **Sun:** Post “Thanks + Next Week” (Prompt 10).

## Do this, not that (micro prompt tweaks)

- **Do** include your town, day/time, audience (“family-friendly”), and CTA.  
- **Do** set the length (“60–80 words”), tone (“warm, British”), and format.  
- **Don’t** paste personal data (no bookings/mailing lists).  
- **Don’t** skip edits — double-check dates, prices, allergens, licensing lines.

---

## Keep it safe (stickers for the staff room)

- Treat AI like a junior: **you approve the final**.  
- **No personal data** in prompts.  
- Contact only people who’ve **opted in** (or meet soft opt-in).  
- Music nights still need **TheMusicLicence** — AI doesn’t change that.
