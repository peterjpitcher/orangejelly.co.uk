## 1. Time & Capacity Claims

- **Primary proof point**: “We’ve unlocked **25 hours of value per week** by applying AI across our pub.”
- **Customer promise**: “Work with us and **save up to 25 hours every week**—no retainers, just hourly support.”
- **Content workflows**: “We plan and schedule **30 days of social content in 2 hours** using AI batching systems.”
- **Availability**: “Message me anytime—I’ll get back **as quickly as I can, but bear with me if I’m in service.**”
- **Quick advice**: “Short chats and quick questions are always free—I’m happy to jump on the phone if you just need ten minutes.”

## 2. Timeline & Results

- **Core promise**: “See meaningful, bankable progress **inside 30 days**. That’s our default for every plan.”
- **Early momentum framing**:
  - **Week 1** – “Expect more traffic to your website and more phone calls.”
  - **Week 2** – “Momentum builds; we keep tuning before promising busier nights.”
  - **Week 4** – “Noticeably fuller evenings and consistent enquiries.”
  - **6 months** – “Full transformation when you stick with the playbook.”
- **Menu/website/event timelines**:
  - Menu delivery: **3–5 business days**
  - Website live (templated builds): **1–2 weeks**
  - First event activation: **10 days to 3 weeks**
  - Full implementation cycles: **4 weeks**

## 3. Performance Metrics

- **Social reach**: “We reach **60,000–70,000 people every month** on social media—achieved through consistent AI-assisted workflows.”

## 4. Attendance & Revenue

- **Weekday performance**: “Weekday revenue lifted **~20%** after implementing the first AI-led changes.”
- **Opted-in list**: “We currently have **250 opted-in SMS contacts** we can activate.”
- **Lost revenue framing**: “An empty wet-led table costs less than the £30–£50 figure you see online—context matters.”

## 5. Financial & Pricing

## 6. Guarantees & Service Promises

- **30-day action plan** with weekly check-ins is included in every engagement.
- **No refunds**. Instead, we run a **hands-on partnership guarantee**: we stay involved until the agreed plan delivers measurable results.
- **“Save time or make more money inside 30 days”** is acceptable copy when paired with the partnership statement above.
- **No agency fees**: “We’re not an agency—we’re licensees sharing what works.”
- **Risk-free chat**: “Reach out with zero commitment; we’ll be honest if we’re not the right fit.”
- **From one licensee to another**: Always reinforce that **Billy runs The Anchor day-to-day while Peter handles marketing/business development in spare time**. Highlight the partnership dynamic so prospects understand who does what.

### Usage Notes
1. **Do not reintroduce “results in 14 days” or “save 5+ hours” phrasing**—the new standard is “save up to 25 hours” and “inside 30 days.”
2. **Percentages above 20%** (covers, bookings, attendance) should only appear as historical anecdotes, not forward-looking promises.
3. If you need a new claim, add it here (with source context) before publishing anywhere else. This document is the master checklist for content, sales collateral, and compliance reviews.
