# BII Summer Hub 2026 — task plan

**Goal:** A summer hub for the BII ("British Institute of Innkeeping") magazine feature *"Five ways to turn summer footfall into summer revenue"*, reachable via a printed QR code. Reuse the existing seasonal-hub structure; do NOT duplicate existing guides — link each idea to its (renovated) existing guide.

**Decisions (approved by Peter):**
- Strategy: Hub → existing guides, each guide renovated to fit its idea (no new spoke pages → no SEO cannibalisation).
- Short link: `/summer` → summer hub, mirroring `/autumn` & `/christmas`, with BII tracking.
- Hub slug: `/licensees-guide/summer-pub-marketing`. publishedDate 2026-06-01 (live now; magazine lands ~24 Jul).

**Idea → existing guide map:**
1. Create bookable reasons to visit → `summer-pub-event-ideas`
2. Make every post lead somewhere → `social-media-strategy-for-pubs`
3. Keep your Google listing fresh → `google-business-profile-pub-guide`
4. Capture customer details while trade is high → `email-marketing-pub-retention`
5. Follow up and bring people back → `build-loyalty-scheme-fill-pub`

**Guardrails:** Only approved %-based claims (/CLAIMS.md). British English only (the british-english check blocks US spellings). Avoid the cost-reduction word family the growth-language hook rejects — use growth/margin language instead. Match the existing hub markdown conventions.
